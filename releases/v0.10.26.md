# Jul 2025 (v0.10.26)

Released on Mon Jul 14 19:44:27 2025 +0700.

Mochi v0.10.26 introduces JOB dataset examples and refines compiler output across
languages while fixing several TPCH issues.

## Examples

- JOB dataset queries compiled across languages with golden tests
- Updated TPCH outputs with improved struct names and dataclasses

## Compilers

- Python dataclasses unify field types, implement iteration and format lists
- Go compiler inlines list printing and infers structs for query selects
- TypeScript simplifies group-by logic and spreads values when appending
- C backend tracks stack arrays and emits static arrays for struct lists
- C++ and Java fix struct references with refined dataclass types

## Runtime

- C backend adds join grouping support with stack-based arrays
- Go backend prints typed lists with single struct declarations

## Documentation

- Machine READMEs refreshed with dataset tasks and compiler notes
