## Transpilers

- F# transpiler now handles array strings, typed maps and dictionaries

- Rust and Clojure generation extended with function prototypes and catamorphism
- Rosetta outputs refreshed for Dart, Go and more

## Fixes

- Base64 decode and return handling bugs resolved
- Corrected Dart map index null handling and improved float literal casting
