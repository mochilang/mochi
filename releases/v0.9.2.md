# Jun 2025 (v0.9.2)

Mochi v0.9.2 delivers major VM upgrades with new builtins and optimizations alongside broader compiler support. Debugging tools and tests have also been enhanced.

## Runtime

- Specialized numeric bytecode with CFG-based register inference
- Dynamic map literals, membership checks and iteration
- Builtins `append`, `str`, `input`, `count`, `avg` and an extended `len`
- Partial application, tail call optimization and unary negation
- Nested index assignment and list set operations
- Error stack traces from the VM
- Variable declarations enforced on assignment

## Compilers

- Nested function support in the C backend
- Exported functions in the Zig backend
- Functions and lambdas in the PL backend
- Scala infers function expression types

## Tooling

- `vmreport` command for VM analysis
- Interpreter golden tests run via the VM
- Benchmarks updated without PyPy or Cython
- Ruby lambda helpers propagate correctly
