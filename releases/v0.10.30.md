# Jul 2025 (v0.10.30)

Released on Fri Jul 18 18:44:32 2025 +0700.

Mochi v0.10.30 expands Rosetta Code coverage with many new examples while refining compilers and the virtual machine across languages.

## Examples

- New Rosetta solutions including numeric sequences and file tasks
- Pascal 21-game output regenerated
- Numerous README and golden output updates across languages

## Compilers

- Erlang adds basic loop support
- Racket, Java, F#, Swift and Pascal gain `input`/`now` builtins
- Go handles typed append and string conversions
- Kotlin supports float casts and safe `now`
- Scala, C# and others sanitize identifiers and improve inference

## Runtime

- Virtual machine supports global variables and fixes puzzle output
- Go backend provides deterministic `now()` and typed append
- C backend fixes capture assignment handling
- Python backend handles bare returns and globals

## Documentation

- Rosetta checklists added for many languages
- READMEs updated with compilation status and results
