# Aug 2025 (v0.10.71)

Released on Sat Aug 23 14:49:16 2025 +0700.

Mochi v0.10.71 introduces broad file I/O and logical operator support across transpilers, expands algorithm benchmarks, and improves big integer handling.

## Transpilers

- `not` operator implemented for Zig, TypeScript, Scala, Rust, OCaml, Java and Lua.
- `read_file` and `ord` builtins added across C, C++, Zig, TypeScript, Scheme, Scala, Rust, Racket, Ruby, Python, Pascal, PHP, OCaml, Kotlin, Go, Erlang, Clojure and Swift.
- C# gains a BigInteger mode while C++ adds big integer printing and parsing helpers.
- Go transpiler adds `__name__` and improves list printing; C supports nested list concatenation and a simple neural network algorithm.
- Introduces OHP transpiler with benchmarks for 50 string algorithms.

## Algorithms

- Expanded and refreshed algorithm outputs across Racket, Ruby, PHP, Dart and more.
