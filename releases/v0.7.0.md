# Jun 2025 (v0.7.0)

Mochi v0.7.0 streamlines agent communication, extends the foreign function interface and introduces a new `eval` builtin. Package imports can now reference local files and directories, making it easier to organize modules.

## Agents and Streams

Agents now use stream-backed mailboxes with optional waiting semantics for deterministic ordering of events.

## Foreign Function Interface

Go, Python and TypeScript runtimes list available packages and provide helpers to export extern declarations. The Go FFI supports struct types and method calls.

## Builtins

An `eval` function evaluates a string of Mochi code at runtime.

## Package Imports

Relative paths starting with `./` or `../` can import local modules from single files or directories.
