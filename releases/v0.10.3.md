# Jun 2025 (v0.10.3)

Released on Thu Jun 26 18:37:31 2025 +0700.

Mochi v0.10.3 introduces typed dataset fetch and JSON persistence. Many
compilers now emit typed fetch helpers with HTTP tests while datasets can
be loaded from and saved to JSON files.

## Runtime

- `fetch` builtin supports HTTP options and struct casting
- JSON dataset load and save operations

## Compilers

- Typed fetch helpers implemented across languages
- JSON load/save support for many backends

## Fixes

- Type inference for dataset load generics
- Pascal string quoting issue and updated golden tests
- Erlang fetch runtime corrections
