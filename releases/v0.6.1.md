# Jun 2025 (v0.6.1)

Mochi v0.6.1 adds file I/O for datasets, a minimal foreign function interface and optional DuckDB execution for queries.

## Load and Save

Use `load` to read CSV or JSONL data into a typed list and `save` to export results. Paths are optional for piping via standard input and output.

```mochi
let people = load "people.csv" as Person
let adults = from p in people where p.age >= 18 select p
save adults to "adults.jsonl" with { format: "jsonl" }
```

## Foreign Function Interface

The new `runtime/ffi` package exposes Go, TypeScript and Python runtimes. Programs declare `extern fun` and `extern object` bindings which resolve to registered host implementations.

## DuckDB Query Engine

Dataset queries can execute through DuckDB for larger data sets. Builds without CGO fall back to the in-memory engine.

## Other Changes

- `--wasm-toolchain` flag selects the Go or TinyGo compiler
- Improved type inference across compilers
- Fixed DuckDB optional build and updated golden tests
