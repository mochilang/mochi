# Jul 2025 (v0.10.25)

Released on Sun Jul 13 09:42:07 2025 +0700.

Mochi v0.10.25 finalizes TPC‑H coverage across all compilers with deterministic headers and numerous code generation improvements. Language backends see refined type inference and printing while examples expand to queries 1‑22.

## Examples

- Generated artifacts for TPC‑H queries 1–22 across languages
- Updated machine READMEs and golden outputs

## Compilers

- Zig infers structs for query results and handles group slices
- C#, Java and Kotlin improve equality checks, integer division and map typing
- C and C++ compilers simplify initialization and match defaults
- Rust and Python better handle float casting and typed dataclasses
- TypeScript, Dart and Ex/Erlang gain full TPCH support
- Added version headers with deterministic timestamps

## Runtime

- C backend fixes list helpers and supports dynamic list loops

## Documentation

- Task checklists updated for Go, Rust, Kotlin and more
