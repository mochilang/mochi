- Compiled functions optimized automatically
- Disassembly improvements for casts, sort operations and existence checks
- Null index and iterator tolerance with append liveness fixes

## Tooling

- Formatter integration across all language backends
- Cosmo and tcc toolchain updates
- JOB dataset task list added

## Fixes
