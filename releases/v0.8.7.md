# Jun 2025 (v0.8.7)

Mochi v0.8.7 polishes the experimental compilers with new language features and
additional golden tests. Several backends gain better loop handling and improved
code generation.

## Compilers

- Break and continue support in the Scala backend with updated tests
- COBOL loops handle grouped ranges, negative counts and modulo operations
- Ruby adds struct casts and multi-function examples
- Dart emits a trailing newline and expands map/list operations
- Fortran supports 64-bit literals and refreshed LeetCode solutions
- Rust printing improved with factorial and fibonacci tests
- Smalltalk compiler parenthesizes expressions and gains new tests
- Clojure includes runtime helpers only when required

## Tests

- New golden tests for Scala, COBOL, Ruby, Dart, Fortran, Rust and Smalltalk
- Expanded coverage of list, map and float operations across languages
