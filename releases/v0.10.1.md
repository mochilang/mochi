# Jun 2025 (v0.10.1)

Released on Thu Jun 26 08:03:05 2025 +0700.

Mochi v0.10.1 expands dataset queries with aggregate features and introduces
test blocks across languages. Map sorting and additional builtins improve
the runtime while compilers gain new query helpers.

## Runtime

- Map sort capability for dictionaries
- HAVING clause and aggregate query support
- `exists`, `contains` and `substring` builtins
- Grouping by multiple expressions
- Improved disassembly and runtime tests

## Compilers

- Test blocks and `expect` statements across backends
- Aggregate helpers and `sum`/`min`/`max` builtins
- Python grouping sort and Go query `any` handling
- C++ JSON escaping fixes for map literals
- CLI `run` defaults to the VM

## Fixes

- Numerous TPC-H query syntax and dataset corrections
- Java map key handling in queries
