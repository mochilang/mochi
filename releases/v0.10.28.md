- Deterministic `values()` builtin ensures reproducible examples

## Compilers

- Struct inference refined in C#, Kotlin, Scala and Rust
- `string_prefix_slice` builtin output for Zig
- Map literal pair grouping and constant aggregates in the C backend
- List indexing and join generation optimized for Go and Scala
- JSON builtin for OCaml with improved helpers
- Printing and quoting improved for Lua, Pascal and Erlang

## Runtime

- Deterministic values builtin available in the Go runtime
- Precomputed counts for constant integer lists in the C backend
- JSON helpers expanded across languages

## Documentation

- Machine READMEs updated with BigInt notes and new checklists
