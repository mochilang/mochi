# Jul 2025 (v0.10.27)

Released on Wed Jul 16 22:58:30 2025 +0700.

Mochi v0.10.27 expands Rosetta Code coverage with deterministic outputs and new
virtual machine features while refining compilers across languages.

## Examples

- Rosetta Code programs compiled across languages with golden tests
- Deterministic `now()` builtin ensures reproducible timestamps
- Machine outputs refreshed for datasets and tasks

## Compilers

- Virtual machine adds global variable support and entry aliasing
- `sha256` builtin and join length fixes in the C backend
- Reserved names escaped in PHP and keywords handled in Kotlin
- Struct literals for Smalltalk and FFI print helpers for Lua
- Go and C++ indexing and collection improvements
- Ex compiler length helper and TypeScript outer joins sort correctly

## Runtime

- Rosetta VM test runner executes programs consistently
- Fortran newline handling corrected for generated code
- Faster compilation when packages include slow build tags

## Documentation

- Machine READMEs updated with Rosetta tasks and slow build tags
