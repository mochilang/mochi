# Jun 2025 (v0.8.8)

Mochi v0.8.8 expands data access operations and test support across the
experimental compilers. Numerous backends gain new builtins, improved query
features and additional language constructs.

## Compilers

- Dataset `fetch`, `generate`, `load` and `save` in Ruby, Erlang, Elixir,
  Java and Scheme
- Method declarations for Ruby and Dart with type methods in Kotlin
- Test block support in Scala, Java, F#, Zig, Swift and C
- Negative list indexing for Swift and Scala
- `sort by` queries in C++ and `where`/`skip`/`take` in F#
- JSON helpers and a `now` builtin across Haskell, Kotlin, Zig and F#
- Pagination added to the Rust backend with string list helpers in C
- COBOL loops over string variables and typed return values
- Racket conditional branches and selectors
- Fortran append builtin and typed list operations

## Tests

- New golden tests for dataset operations, methods and loops across
  compilers
- Updated examples for C++, Rust and others
