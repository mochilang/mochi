# Jun 2025 (v0.9.1)

Mochi v0.9.1 refines the runtime and development tools. The VM now supports
function expressions, generic calls and map indexing with clearer call
traces. The JIT handles simple functions while the REPL switches to a
lightweight terminal interface. Benchmarks and the TypeScript runtime have
been refreshed along with numerous fixes.

## Runtime

- Function expressions and generic calls in the VM
- Map indexing operations
- Human-readable call disassembly
- `now` builtin bug fixed

## Tooling

- Simple function support for the JIT
- REPL updated without Bubble Tea TUI and shows evaluation results
- Benchmarks include IR and C outputs with corrected C runtime results
- TypeScript runtime computes globals at runtime
- Tests reorganized under a single folder
