# Jul 2025 (v0.10.23)

Released on Fri Jul 11 15:23:14 2025 +0700.

Mochi v0.10.23 extends foreign function interfaces across languages, boosts
struct inference and improves memory handling in the C backend. Numerous Rosetta
Code examples showcase these capabilities with updated compiler outputs.

## Examples

- Added a wide range of Rosetta Code tasks such as arithmetic operations,
  array processing and puzzles including 15‑puzzle and 2048
- Updated Go and Python tasks with automatic FFI compilation helpers
- New examples demonstrating Active Directory search and attractive numbers

## Compilers

- Automatic struct inference for C#, Kotlin, Python, Scala, Swift, Java and Go
- TypeScript compiler generates stronger types with simpler query chains
- C backend now uses `calloc` with allocation checks, supports JSON structs and
  stack‑based list literals
- Java compiler improves FFI imports, struct naming and descriptive class names
- C++ compiler adds group‑by support with better type inference and JSON output
- Zig compiler handles struct mutation and constant string operations
- Rust compiler compiles FFI imports and refines `in` operator logic
- Go compiler features sprint helper, auto FFI and improved variable names

## Runtime

- Virtual machine introduces basic Go and Python FFI support
- Builtin module infrastructure for the C backend

## Documentation

- Machine READMEs refreshed with updated task lists and outputs
