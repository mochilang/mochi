# Jun 2025 (v0.6.0)

Mochi v0.6.0 introduces **dataset queries** for filtering, joining and grouping lists. Programs can now build analysis pipelines using SQL-like syntax. The release also ships a WebAssembly compiler, notebook integration and new set operations for lists.

## Dataset Queries

```mochi
let result = from o in orders
             join from c in customers on o.customerId == c.id
             where o.total > 100
             group by c.name into g
             select { name: g.key, total: sum(from r in g select r.total) }
```

## WebAssembly Compiler

The `wasm` compiler emits WebAssembly binaries using the Go toolchain or TinyGo so Mochi programs run in the browser.

## List Set Operations

Lists support `union`, `union all`, `except` and `intersect` operators for combining results.

## Other Changes

- `%%mochi` Jupyter cell magic
- Vector search runtime with a flat index
- Dataset query support across Go, Python and TypeScript compilers
