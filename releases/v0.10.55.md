Mochi v0.10.55 broadens Rosetta benchmark coverage and strengthens map and list handling across transpilers while refining cross-language outputs and addressing several typing bugs.

## Transpilers

- Kotlin adds circular primes and call-a-function examples with struct method support
- Pascal, Racket and Zig transpilers expand dynamic map features, printing and multi-argument capabilities
- Go, PHP, Ruby and others regenerate Rosetta outputs for broader benchmark support

## Benchmarks

- New metrics and examples including Floydâ€“Warshall, Cholesky decomposition and bubble sort
- Expanded Rosetta outputs across Java, F#, Erlang, Prolog and more

## Fixes

- Corrected Java list literal typing, Kotlin map assignment and Scala lambda returns
- Resolved Swift BigInt modulo overflow and Ruby fetch helper dependency
- Fixed PHP benchmark timing and other minor bugs
