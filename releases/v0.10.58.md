Mochi v0.10.58 adds a large collection of algorithm and data structure examples, broadens image processing coverage, and improves transpilers across multiple languages.

## Algorithms and Data Structures

- Introduces dynamic programming samples including knapsack, longest common subsequence, Floydâ€“Warshall, matrix chain order and more
- Adds divide and conquer implementations such as merge sort, Strassen matrix multiplication and peak finding
- Expands data structure examples with stacks, queues, linked lists, suffix trees, tries and KD-trees

## Image Processing

- Implements Sobel, Gaussian, Gabor and Laplacian filters along with brightness, contrast and dithering utilities
- Adds morphological operations, edge detection and convolution helpers

## Transpilers

- Enhances language backends with slice builtins, map iteration, subprocess support and refined type inference
- Updates Rosetta benchmark outputs for Kotlin, Swift, C#, Scheme and others

## Fixes

- Addresses string length handling in Java, numeric casts in Dart and map indexing for OCaml
- Resolves various issues in Kotlin, Swift, C++, Elixir and other transpilers
