Mochi v0.10.2 extends group query features and improves dataset tooling. The runtime gains richer stack traces and a new `values` builtin while compilers add `sum` helpers and group filtering across languages.

## Runtime

- `values` builtin for retrieving map values
- Stack traces include source context
- Fixed binary operator precedence

## Compilers

- `sum` helpers and group-by filtering support in many backends
- Query `let` clause and TPC-H Q1 support across languages
- Improved group iteration and example queries

## Tooling

- Isolated install and TPC-H update tools
- CLI no longer runs via the interpreter

## Fixes

- Numerous TPC-H query and dataset corrections
- Rust map key handling and other compiler updates
