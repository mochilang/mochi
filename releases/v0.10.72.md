# Aug 2025 (v0.10.72)

Released on Sun Aug 24 15:35:26 2025 +0700.

Mochi v0.10.72 expands cross-language transpiler capabilities, refreshes algorithm outputs, and resolves several code generation issues.

## Transpilers

- Zig transpiler supports mutable list literals, dynamic ranges, float equality, arraylist API and map lookups.
- TypeScript resets bench flag, updates heap and radix outputs, and improves float equality.
- Swift adds a heap sort example; Scheme adds sort outputs.
- C transpiler allocates runtime lists for top-level literals, adds map struct helpers, slice functions, map growth, redeclaration and map reset handling, `while` loops and pointer membership, respects user-defined concatenation, and retains ints for unary minus.
- Racket gains vector support.
- Scala introduces custom `contains`, an append alias and an `export` keyword.
- Pascal supports list-to-string conversion, JSONL loading, void returns and integer-keyed maps.
- Rust improves function parameter handling and treats collection literals as non-const.
- Java handles BigInteger and object arrays and supports BigInteger in list literals.
- Go initializes maps on declaration, supports typed slice indices and refines float formatting.
- Python, Ruby, Scala, TypeScript and others refresh algorithm outputs.

## Algorithms

- Added or regenerated Project Euler and algorithm outputs across C, C++, Clojure, Pascal, Ruby, TypeScript, Go, Scala, Racket and more.
- Recorded failure case for Project Euler problem 22 solution 2 to track correctness.
