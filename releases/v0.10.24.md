# Jul 2025 (v0.10.24)

Released on Sat Jul 12 16:18:37 2025 +0700.

Mochi v0.10.24 expands dataset coverage with TPC‑H examples, adds many new Rosetta Code translations and refines compilers across the board. The C runtime gains array helpers while the virtual machine improves bigint support.

## Examples

- Dozens of new Rosetta Code tasks including Barnsley fern, Benford's law and Bresenham line
- Added TPC‑H query 1 tests and updated dataset outputs
- Refreshed Python, Go and Fortran examples

## Compilers

- C backend introduces bool list arrays, list length helpers and outer/right join support
- TypeScript compiler checks global types, preserves doc comments and uses interface-based structs
- Scala compiler improves group and join generation with safe division and option types
- Kotlin, Java and C# compilers refine builtin imports and typed grouping
- Python, C++, Rust and Go compilers enhance type inference and printing helpers

## Runtime

- Virtual machine handles bigint division and updated TPC‑H IR
- Printing helpers support lists of structs with array-based lists
- Memory usage reduced for aggregates and list operations

## Documentation

- Machine READMEs updated with remaining tasks and runtime notes
- Clarified helper removal and marked async support complete
