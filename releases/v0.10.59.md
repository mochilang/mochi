Mochi v0.10.59 introduces numerous web API integrations and greatly expands the algorithm library across strings, sorting, graphs, dynamic programming and utilities.

## API Examples

- Adds examples for world COVID stats, GitHub info, Slack webhooks and Reddit data
- Provides integrations for Open Library ISBN search, Recaptcha verification, random anime, Google search and NASA data
- Includes scripts for Instagram media downloading and crawling, Giphy GIF search, Hacker News top posts, Forbes billionaire data and IP geolocation

## Algorithms

- Introduces extensive string utilities and search algorithms: wave string, strip, case conversions, splits and reversals along with validators for emails, phone numbers and national IDs
- Implements search and similarity algorithms such as Rabin–Karp, KMP, Bitap, Boyer–Moore, Jaro-Winkler and Levenshtein distance
- Adds numerous sorting routines including quick sort variants, radix and merge sorts, shell sort and topological sort examples
- Expands graph coverage with BFS/DFS variants, Dijkstra and A* searches, MST algorithms (Prim, Kruskal, Boruvka) and SCC detection
- Provides dynamic programming samples like word break, subset sum, rod cutting, Viterbi, Smith–Waterman and more
- Includes additional math, financial, physics and fractal utilities like Ohm's law, inductive reactance, geometric formulas and fractal generators
