Mochi v0.8.2 expands the set of experimental compilers and aligns features across languages. Build tooling and benchmarks now recognize every backend with a new wave of golden tests.

- Cross join and sort/skip/take query operations in C#, Dart, Elixir and Erlang
- Negative string indexing and slicing supported in Java, Swift and Lua
- Map literals and membership checks in Java, Scala and Swift
- Union types, casting and local functions in Ruby and Scala
- `input`, `str`, `count` and `avg` builtins across Kotlin, Swift and C#
- Extensive golden tests covering all backends

## Build System

- `mochi build` handles every compiler target
- Benchmarks can compile C output
