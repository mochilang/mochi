# Aug 2025 (v0.10.56)

Released on Sun Aug 03 10:08:34 2025 +0700.

Mochi v0.10.56 expands Rosetta benchmark coverage, improves benchmark memory reporting, and upgrades multiple transpilers.

## Transpilers

- Scheme adds struct method support and typed division/mod operations
- Pascal introduces padStart, Int64 lists, and additional Rosetta outputs including Benford's law
- Racket, Scala and Kotlin gain numerous new Rosetta benchmark outputs
- C++ and Rust benchmarks report memory usage directly with improved detection
- Zig and C# refine memory capture and variable mutability

## Benchmarks

- Racket benchmark suite adds 50 new Rosetta programs plus character code examples
- New benchmark data for Pascal, Scala, Kotlin, Erlang and more expands Rosetta coverage
- Benchmarks report more accurate memory statistics across languages

## Fixes

- Resolved memory detection issues in C++, Rust, Zig, C and TypeScript transpilers
- Improved map and list handling across Pascal, Kotlin and Rust
- Addressed benchmark timing and string comparison inconsistencies
