# Jun 2025 (v0.8.6)

Mochi v0.8.6 brings the first five LeetCode examples to every experimental compiler. New language features and runners make these programs compile and run across the entire project.

## Compilers

- Pascal, OCaml, Ruby, Java, Scala and Zig outputs for LeetCode 1–5
- Updated C#, PHP and Smalltalk solutions

## Tooling

- `leetcode-runner` verifies toolchain availability before execution
- SWI-Prolog path can be configured when running examples

## Tests

- Generated and updated golden outputs for LeetCode problems 1–5 across all languages

## Fixes

- Corrected F# string indexing, Java underscore handling and COBOL generation
- Resolved Clojure string concatenation, Erlang branch formatting and other compiler issues
