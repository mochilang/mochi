# Aug 2025 (v0.10.68)

Released on Sun Aug 17 08:35:51 2025 +0000.

Mochi v0.10.68 broadens algorithm coverage and sharpens numeric handling across transpilers.

## Transpilers

- PHP casts operands in `intdiv` and supports the `panic` builtin.
- Kotlin maps `ln` and `exp` to `kotlin.math` and widens algorithm support.
- Go folds `pow10` to reduce floating-point error.
- Dart and Java refine string index and digit casts.
- C and C++ improve float formatting and indexing safety.
- Zig enables custom floor functions and adds collinear point detection.
- Lua prints float decimals and streamlines iteration.
- Scheme, Racket, and Erlang polish numeric conversions and indexing.

## Algorithms

- Added `points_are_collinear_3d` and gradient descent implementations.
- Expanded algorithm outputs for Kotlin, Ruby, F#, Pascal, and Erlang through index 737.
- Refreshed Hardyâ€“Ramanujan, weird number, and other math benchmarks across languages.
- Updated benchmarks including Project Euler problem 71 and Go's primelib.
- Improved Python benchmark memory reporting and removed stale error logs.
