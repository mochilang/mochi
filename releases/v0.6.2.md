# Jun 2025 (v0.6.2)

Mochi v0.6.2 expands the foreign function interface and adds more data loading options.

## Foreign Function Interface

Programs can `import` modules from Go, Python and TypeScript and call them through new FFI runtimes. A Deno runtime enables TypeScript interoperability.

```mochi
import go "math" as math
import python "polars" as pl

extern fun math.Sqrt(x: float): float
extern fun pl.col(name: string): any
```

## Dataset Loaders

`load` now supports JSON and YAML files in addition to CSV.

```mochi
let people = load "people.yaml" as Person
```

## Other Changes

- FFI code moved to `runtime/ffi`
- Fixed notebook magic path and TypeScript import tests
