# Aug 2025 (v0.10.70)

Released on Fri Aug 22 14:19:51 2025 +0700.

Mochi v0.10.70 broadens algorithm coverage and refines numeric handling across transpilers.

## Transpilers

- Pascal adds union and map helpers.
- Kotlin introduces `Math.floorMod`.
- C transpiler supports string-double map literals and reserved-name aliasing.
- Racket ships neural network algorithms.
- Scala, Swift, Ruby and Python improve float emission and printing.
- Java optimizes array calls and folds zero subtraction to unary minus.
- TypeScript folds `pow10` constants and updates algorithm outputs.
- PHP, Go, Scala, Ruby and Erlang refresh algorithm benchmarks.
- OCaml handles map lookups and printing; Lua improves typed list helpers.

## Algorithms

- Algorithm outputs expanded across TypeScript, Go, Scala, Ruby, PHP, Erlang and more.
- Neural network implementations added for Racket and refreshed across languages.
