# Jun 2025 (v0.8.3)

Mochi v0.8.3 finalizes documentation for every experimental compiler backend and improves installation helpers across operating systems. Numerous language features have been added with expanded golden tests.

## Compilers

- CLI exposes all compiler targets and accepts `python` as an alias
- Basic Zig backend and dedicated READMEs for all languages
- Union types, match expressions and closures in Rust, Kotlin and Lua
- While loops and break/continue statements across Scheme, Smalltalk and F#
- Cross join queries, struct support and list slicing in various backends
- Golden tests added for C, COBOL, Pascal, Prolog, Fortran, OCaml and more

## Tooling

- Cross-platform installation scripts for COBOL, Fortran, Haskell, Erlang, Pascal, Lua and others
- C++ backend supports range loops
- Improved dotnet and Rust setup on Linux and macOS

## Tests

- Non-Python compilers exclude Python golden outputs
- Additional closure and dataset query tests

## Fixes

- Corrected average calculation and list concatenation in the C backend
- Assignment handling fixed in the Clojure compiler
- Boolean literals corrected in Erlang output
- Query printing fixed in the Ruby backend
- Smalltalk backend compilation issues resolved
