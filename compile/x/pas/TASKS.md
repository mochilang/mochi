# Pascal Backend Tasks for TPCH Q1

The Pascal backend now supports executing the first TPCH query. Recent work
added record types for dataset rows, dynamic arrays for query results and
helper functions for aggregations. Groups are implemented using `TFPGMap` and
a small JSON printer is included for test output.

Future improvements could extend coverage to the remaining TPCH queries and
expand runtime error handling.
