# PHP Backend Tasks for TPCH Q1

The PHP backend runs basic scripts but lacks dataset query support.

- Translate `group by` into associative array accumulation with nested loops.
- Implement helpers `sum`, `avg` and `count` using PHP arrays.
- Represent records as associative arrays with string keys.
- Use `json_encode` for output and create tests under `tests/compiler/php`.
