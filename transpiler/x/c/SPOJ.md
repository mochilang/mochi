# C SPOJ Transpiler Output

This directory stores C code generated from Mochi programs in `tests/spoj/x/mochi`. Each file is compiled and executed during tests. Successful runs keep the generated `.c` source along with a matching `.out` file. Failures are recorded in `.error` files when tests run with `-ctrans_update`.
