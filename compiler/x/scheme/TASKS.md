# Scheme Backend Tasks for TPCH Queries

The Scheme backend now targets chibi-scheme and can compile the `tpc-h/q1.mochi` and `tpc-h/q2.mochi` benchmarks. Initial JOB dataset support was explored for `job/q1.mochi`. Later queries compile but fail at runtime because sorting and date operations are incomplete.

### Recent Enhancements
- 2025-07-13 05:05 â€“ Added machine generated output for `tpc-h/q1.mochi` and updated checklist.

### Remaining Work
- [ ] Better handling of date comparisons and sorting when running JOB benchmarks
- [ ] More efficient dataset grouping and aggregation
- [ ] Support for concurrent agents and streaming primitives
- [ ] Improve macro support for generated Scheme code
- [ ] Add pattern matching for union types
- [ ] Implement async/await semantics
- [ ] Optimize tail-call recursion
- [ ] Enhance foreign function interface bindings
- [ ] Provide REPL mode for compiled programs
- [ ] Add generic type parameter compilation
- [ ] Extend dataset query language with window functions
- [ ] Improve error messages for invalid constructs
