# Swift Compiler Progress

## Recent Enhancements
- 2025-07-13 05:09 – improved type inference for `append()` calls so list variables adopt the element type.
- 2025-07-13 07:03 – fixed nested selector handling and avoided unnecessary casts when grouping by built-in keys.
- 2025-07-13 07:31 – added optional-aware struct generation for join queries.

## Remaining Work

- [ ] Compile full TPC-H `q1.mochi` without manual adjustments
- [ ] Resolve runtime issues with outer and right joins
