# Smalltalk to Mochi converter

This directory stores golden files for converting Smalltalk source back into Mochi using the `stast` parser. In addition to assignments, `print` statements and basic `whileTrue:` loops the fallback converter now also handles simple `for` loops and `ifTrue:/ifFalse:` blocks.
