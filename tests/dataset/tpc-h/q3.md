# TPC-H Query 3 – Shipping Priority

[q3.mochi](./q3.mochi) supplies a minimal dataset of customers, orders and line items. Only the customer in the `BUILDING` market segment has an order before the cutoff date that ships afterwards, so the query aggregates revenue for that order only.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT
  l_orderkey,
  SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue,
  o_orderdate,
  o_shippriority
FROM
  customer,
  orders,
  lineitem
WHERE
  c_mktsegment = ':segment'
  AND c_custkey = o_custkey
  AND l_orderkey = o_orderkey
  AND o_orderdate < DATE ':date'
  AND l_shipdate > DATE ':date'
GROUP BY
  l_orderkey, o_orderdate, o_shippriority
ORDER BY
  revenue DESC, o_orderdate;
```

## Expected Output
The single qualifying order has two line items with revenue `1000×0.95` and `500`, totalling `1450`. Therefore the result is:
```json
[
  {
    "l_orderkey": 100,
    "revenue": 1450.0,
    "o_orderdate": "1995-03-14",
    "o_shippriority": 1
  }
]
```
