# TPC-H Query 5 – Local Supplier Volume

[q5.mochi](./q5.mochi) provides customers and suppliers from two Asian nations. Each nation has a single order in 1994 placed and fulfilled locally. The query sums revenue for each nation.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT
  n_name,
  SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue
FROM
  customer,
  orders,
  lineitem,
  supplier,
  nation,
  region
WHERE
  c_custkey = o_custkey
  AND l_orderkey = o_orderkey
  AND l_suppkey = s_suppkey
  AND c_nationkey = s_nationkey
  AND s_nationkey = n_nationkey
  AND n_regionkey = r_regionkey
  AND r_name = 'ASIA'
  AND o_orderdate >= DATE '1994-01-01'
  AND o_orderdate < DATE '1995-01-01'
GROUP BY
  n_name
ORDER BY
  revenue DESC;
```

## Expected Output
The Japanese order produces `1000×(1-0.05)=950` revenue and the Indian order produces `800×(1-0.10)=720`.
```json
[
  { "n_name": "JAPAN", "revenue": 950.0 },
  { "n_name": "INDIA", "revenue": 720.0 }
]
```
