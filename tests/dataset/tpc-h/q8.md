# TPC-H Query 8 – National Market Share

[q8.mochi](./q8.mochi) calculates a nation's share of revenue for a particular part type within the American region during 1995–1996. The dataset contains one Brazilian order and one Canadian order, both in 1995.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT
  o_year,
  SUM(CASE
      WHEN nation = ':nation'
      THEN l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)
      ELSE 0 END) / SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS mkt_share
FROM
  part, supplier, lineitem, orders, customer, nation, region
WHERE
  p_partkey = l_partkey
  AND s_suppkey = l_suppkey
  AND l_orderkey = o_orderkey
  AND o_custkey = c_custkey
  AND c_nationkey = n_nationkey
  AND n_regionkey = r_regionkey
  AND r_name = 'AMERICA'
  AND o_orderdate BETWEEN DATE '1995-01-01' AND DATE '1996-12-31'
  AND p_type = 'ECONOMY ANODIZED STEEL'
GROUP BY
  o_year
ORDER BY
  o_year;
```

## Expected Output
In the sample data, Brazil contributes revenue `900` out of a total `1375`, giving a market share of `900/1375 ≈ 0.6545`.
```json
[
  { "o_year": "1995", "mkt_share": 0.6545 }
]
```
