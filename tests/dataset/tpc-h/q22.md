# TPC-H Query 22 â€“ Global Sales Opportunity

[q22.mochi](./q22.mochi) selects customers from certain phone prefixes who have above-average account balances and no orders. The example has three customers, two of whom meet these criteria.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT
  cntrycode,
  COUNT(*) AS numcust,
  SUM(c_acctbal) AS totacctbal
FROM (
  SELECT
    SUBSTRING(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2) AS cntrycode,
    c_acctbal
  FROM
    customer
  WHERE
    SUBSTRING(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2) IN
      ('13','31','23','29','30','18','17')
    AND c_acctbal > (
      SELECT AVG(c_acctbal)
      FROM customer
      WHERE c_acctbal > 0.00
        AND SUBSTRING(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2) IN
          ('13','31','23','29','30','18','17')
    )
    AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT *
      FROM orders
      WHERE o_custkey = c_custkey
    )
) AS custsale
GROUP BY
  cntrycode
ORDER BY
  cntrycode;
```

## Expected Output
Customers with phone prefixes `13` and `30` have high balances and no orders.
```json
[
  { "cntrycode": "13", "numcust": 1, "totacctbal": 600.0 },
  { "cntrycode": "30", "numcust": 1, "totacctbal": 700.0 }
]
```
