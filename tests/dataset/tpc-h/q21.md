# TPC-H Query 21 â€“ Suppliers Who Kept Orders Waiting

The dataset in [q21.mochi](./q21.mochi) models deliveries from Saudi suppliers. One supplier caused a late receipt on a finalized order and no other supplier on that order was late.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT
  s_name,
  COUNT(*) AS numwait
FROM
  supplier,
  lineitem l1,
  orders,
  nation
WHERE
  s_suppkey = l1.l_suppkey
  AND o_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey
  AND o_orderstatus = 'F'
  AND l1.l_receiptdate > l1.l_commitdate
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT *
    FROM lineitem l2
    WHERE l2.l_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey
      AND l2.l_suppkey <> l1.l_suppkey
      AND l2.l_receiptdate > l2.l_commitdate
  )
  AND s_nationkey = n_nationkey
  AND n_name = 'SAUDI ARABIA'
GROUP BY
  s_name
ORDER BY
  numwait DESC, s_name;
```

## Expected Output
Only "Desert Trade" meets the conditions, yielding a count of one late order.
```json
[
  { "s_name": "Desert Trade", "numwait": 1 }
]
```
