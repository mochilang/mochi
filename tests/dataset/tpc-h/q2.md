# TPC-H Query 2 â€“ Minimum Cost Supplier

The program in [q2.mochi](./q2.mochi) models a small set of parts and suppliers. Only one part matches the size and type filter (`LARGE BRASS` size 15). Among European suppliers, `BestSupplier` offers that part at the lowest cost, so it is the sole result.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT
  s_acctbal,
  s_name,
  n_name,
  p_partkey,
  p_mfgr,
  s_address,
  s_phone,
  s_comment
FROM
  part,
  supplier,
  partsupp,
  nation,
  region
WHERE
  p_partkey = ps_partkey
  AND s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
  AND p_size = :size
  AND p_type LIKE '%BRASS'
  AND s_nationkey = n_nationkey
  AND n_regionkey = r_regionkey
  AND r_name = 'EUROPE'
  AND ps_supplycost = (
    SELECT MIN(ps_supplycost)
    FROM partsupp, supplier, nation, region
    WHERE p_partkey = ps_partkey
      AND s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
      AND s_nationkey = n_nationkey
      AND n_regionkey = r_regionkey
      AND r_name = 'EUROPE'
  )
ORDER BY
  s_acctbal DESC, n_name, s_name, p_partkey;
```

## Expected Output
Because `BestSupplier` is the only European supplier offering the target part at the minimum cost, the query returns:
```json
[
  {
    "s_acctbal": 1000.0,
    "s_name": "BestSupplier",
    "n_name": "FRANCE",
    "p_partkey": 1000,
    "p_mfgr": "M1",
    "s_address": "123 Rue",
    "s_phone": "123",
    "s_comment": "Fast and reliable",
    "ps_supplycost": 10.0
  }
]
```
