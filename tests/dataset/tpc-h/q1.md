# TPC-H Query 1 – Pricing Summary Report

This example mirrors the first TPC-H query. The program in [q1.mochi](./q1.mochi) defines three line items and filters those shipped on or before `1998-09-02`. The first qualifying row has quantity `17`, price `1000`, discount `5%`, and tax `7%`. The second has quantity `36`, price `2000`, discount `10%`, and tax `5%`. Both share return flag `N` and line status `O`, so all aggregates are derived from these two rows.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT
  l_returnflag,
  l_linestatus,
  SUM(l_quantity) AS sum_qty,
  SUM(l_extendedprice) AS sum_base_price,
  SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS sum_disc_price,
  SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) * (1 + l_tax)) AS sum_charge,
  AVG(l_quantity) AS avg_qty,
  AVG(l_extendedprice) AS avg_price,
  AVG(l_discount) AS avg_disc,
  COUNT(*) AS count_order
FROM
  lineitem
WHERE
  l_shipdate <= DATE '1998-09-02'
GROUP BY
  l_returnflag,
  l_linestatus
ORDER BY
  l_returnflag,
  l_linestatus;
```

## Expected Output
The two qualifying rows both have `returnflag` `N` and `linestatus` `O`. Their discounted prices are `1000 × (1 - 0.05) = 950` and `2000 × (1 - 0.10) = 1800`. Adding tax gives charges `950 × 1.07` and `1800 × 1.05`. Aggregating these values yields:
```json
[
  {
    "returnflag": "N",
    "linestatus": "O",
    "sum_qty": 53,
    "sum_base_price": 3000.0,
    "sum_disc_price": 2750.0,
    "sum_charge": 2906.5,
    "avg_qty": 26.5,
    "avg_price": 1500.0,
    "avg_disc": 0.075,
    "count_order": 2
  }
]
```
