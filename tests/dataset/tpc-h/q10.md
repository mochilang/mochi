Let’s move on to **TPC-H Query 10**, which identifies **top customers by revenue** from returned items. It uses filtering, joining, grouping, sorting, and limiting the result set.

## 🧾 TPC-H Query 10 — Returned Item Reporting

### ✅ **SQL Overview**

```sql
SELECT
  c_custkey,
  c_name,
  SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue,
  c_acctbal,
  n_name,
  c_address,
  c_phone,
  c_comment
FROM
  customer,
  orders,
  lineitem,
  nation
WHERE
  c_custkey = o_custkey
  AND l_orderkey = o_orderkey
  AND o_orderdate >= DATE '1993-10-01'
  AND o_orderdate < DATE '1994-01-01'
  AND l_returnflag = 'R'
  AND c_nationkey = n_nationkey
GROUP BY
  c_custkey, c_name, c_acctbal, c_phone, n_name, c_address, c_comment
ORDER BY
  revenue DESC;
```

### 🧠 Purpose

> Computes **customer revenue** from **returned items** (`l_returnflag = 'R'`) during a **date window**, with nation and account metadata.

## 🦊 Mochi Version — Inline + Test

We simulate:

* 2 customers (1 in BRAZIL)
* 2 orders (only 1 in date window)
* 2 lineitems (only 1 flagged `'R'` and linked to the order)

### ✅ Explanation

| Lineitem | Order Date | Return? | Match? | Revenue |
| -------- | ---------- | ------- | ------ | ------- |
| L1       | 1993-10-15 | R       | ✅      | 900.0   |
| L2       | 1994-01-02 | N       | ❌      | —       |

Only one lineitem satisfies all conditions (`order date in range`, `returnflag == R`).
