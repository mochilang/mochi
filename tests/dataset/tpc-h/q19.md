# TPC-H Query 19 â€“ Discounted Revenue

[q19.mochi](./q19.mochi) evaluates three sets of brand and container conditions. In the sample dataset two line items satisfy these filters; a third is excluded because its quantity is too high.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT
  SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue
FROM
  lineitem,
  part
WHERE
  (
    p_partkey = l_partkey AND
    p_brand = 'Brand#12' AND
    p_container IN ('SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 'SM PKG') AND
    l_quantity >= 1 AND l_quantity <= 11 AND
    p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 5 AND
    l_shipmode IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG') AND
    l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'
  )
  OR
  (
    p_partkey = l_partkey AND
    p_brand = 'Brand#23' AND
    p_container IN ('MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK') AND
    l_quantity >= 10 AND l_quantity <= 20 AND
    p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 10 AND
    l_shipmode IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG') AND
    l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'
  )
  OR
  (
    p_partkey = l_partkey AND
    p_brand = 'Brand#34' AND
    p_container IN ('LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG') AND
    l_quantity >= 20 AND l_quantity <= 30 AND
    p_size BETWEEN 1 AND 15 AND
    l_shipmode IN ('AIR', 'AIR REG') AND
    l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'
  );
```

## Expected Output
The first two line items contribute `900` and `1900` in discounted revenue. The third fails the quantity constraint. The sum is:
```text
2800.0
```
