# TPC-H Query 14 â€“ Promotion Effect

The data in [q14.mochi](./q14.mochi) contains two September 1995 shipments, only one of which uses a part with a `PROMO` prefix. The query reports promotional revenue as a percentage of all revenue for that month.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT
  100.00 * SUM(
    CASE
      WHEN p_type LIKE 'PROMO%' THEN l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)
      ELSE 0
    END
  ) / SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS promo_revenue
FROM
  lineitem,
  part
WHERE
  l_partkey = p_partkey
  AND l_shipdate >= DATE '1995-09-01'
  AND l_shipdate < DATE '1995-10-01';
```

## Expected Output
The promotional item contributes `900` out of a total `1700`, so the result is roughly `52.94` percent.
```text
52.94
