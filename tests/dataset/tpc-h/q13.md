# TPC-H Query 13 â€“ Customer Distribution

[q13.mochi](./q13.mochi) examines how many orders each customer placed, ignoring orders containing the text "special requests." In the sample there are three customers, but only one has two qualifying orders.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT
  c_count,
  COUNT(*) AS custdist
FROM (
  SELECT
    c_custkey,
    COUNT(o_orderkey) AS c_count
  FROM
    customer
    LEFT OUTER JOIN orders ON c_custkey = o_custkey
  WHERE
    o_comment NOT LIKE '%special%requests%'
  GROUP BY
    c_custkey
) AS c_orders
GROUP BY
  c_count
ORDER BY
  custdist DESC,
  c_count DESC;
```

## Expected Output
One customer has two valid orders and two customers have none.
```json
[
  { "c_count": 2, "custdist": 1 },
  { "c_count": 0, "custdist": 2 }
]
```
