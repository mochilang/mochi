# TPC-H Query 17 – Small Quantity Order Revenue

[q17.mochi](./q17.mochi) filters line items for a specific brand and container. For part `1` the three quantities `1`, `10`, and `20` sum to `31`, giving an average of `31/3 ≈ 10.33`. The query sums the extended price of rows where the quantity is below `20%` of that average, then divides by `7` to produce a yearly amount.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT
  SUM(l_extendedprice) / 7.0 AS avg_yearly
FROM
  lineitem,
  part
WHERE
  p_partkey = l_partkey
  AND p_brand = ':brand'
  AND p_container = ':container'
  AND l_quantity < (
    SELECT 0.2 * AVG(l_quantity)
    FROM lineitem
    WHERE l_partkey = p_partkey
  );
```

## Expected Output
Only the line item with quantity `1` falls below the `2.066` threshold (`20%` of `10.33`). Its extended price is `100`, so dividing by `7` yields `100 / 7 ≈ 14.2857`.
