# TPC-H Query 9 â€“ Product Type Profit

The example data in [q9.mochi](./q9.mochi) tracks a single qualifying order for a part whose name starts with the required prefix. Only the Brazilian shipment in 1995 falls inside the date window.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT
  nation,
  o_year,
  SUM((l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) - (ps_supplycost * l_quantity)) AS profit
FROM
  part,
  supplier,
  lineitem,
  partsupp,
  orders,
  nation
WHERE
  s_suppkey = l_suppkey
  AND ps_suppkey = l_suppkey
  AND ps_partkey = l_partkey
  AND p_partkey = l_partkey
  AND o_orderkey = l_orderkey
  AND o_orderdate BETWEEN DATE '1995-01-01' AND DATE '1996-12-31'
  AND p_name LIKE ':prefix%'
  AND s_nationkey = n_nationkey
GROUP BY
  nation,
  o_year
ORDER BY
  nation,
  o_year DESC;
```

## Expected Output
The Brazilian line item yields revenue `900` and cost `50`, resulting in profit `850`.
```json
[
  { "nation": "BRAZIL", "o_year": "1995", "profit": 850.0 }
]
```
