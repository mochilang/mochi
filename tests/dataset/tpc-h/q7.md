# TPC-H Query 7 – Volume Shipping by Nation Pair

The scenario in [q7.mochi](./q7.mochi) tracks trade between France and Germany. Only one line item ships within the 1995–1996 window, so the revenue group contains a single entry for 1995.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT
  supp_nation,
  cust_nation,
  l_year,
  SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue
FROM
  supplier, lineitem, orders, customer, nation n1, nation n2
WHERE
  s_suppkey = l_suppkey
  AND o_orderkey = l_orderkey
  AND c_custkey = o_custkey
  AND s_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey
  AND c_nationkey = n2.n_nationkey
  AND (
    (n1.n_name = ':nation1' AND n2.n_name = ':nation2') OR
    (n1.n_name = ':nation2' AND n2.n_name = ':nation1')
  )
  AND l_shipdate BETWEEN DATE '1995-01-01' AND DATE '1996-12-31'
GROUP BY
  supp_nation, cust_nation, l_year
ORDER BY
  supp_nation, cust_nation, l_year;
```

## Expected Output
The only qualifying shipment in the example data is from France to Germany in 1995, generating revenue `1000×0.9 = 900`.
```json
[
  {
    "supp_nation": "FRANCE",
    "cust_nation": "GERMANY",
    "l_year": "1995",
    "revenue": 900.0
  }
]
```
