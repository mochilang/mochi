Let’s continue with **TPC-H Query 7**, one of the more complex queries — involving **multiple joins**, **two nations**, and **time-bound revenue aggregation**.

## 🧾 TPC-H Query 7 — Volume Shipping by Nation Pair

### ✅ **SQL Overview**

```sql
SELECT
  supp_nation,
  cust_nation,
  l_year,
  SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue
FROM
  supplier, lineitem, orders, customer, nation n1, nation n2
WHERE
  s_suppkey = l_suppkey
  AND o_orderkey = l_orderkey
  AND c_custkey = o_custkey
  AND s_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey
  AND c_nationkey = n2.n_nationkey
  AND (
    (n1.n_name = ':nation1' AND n2.n_name = ':nation2') OR
    (n1.n_name = ':nation2' AND n2.n_name = ':nation1')
  )
  AND l_shipdate BETWEEN DATE '1995-01-01' AND DATE '1996-12-31'
GROUP BY
  supp_nation, cust_nation, l_year
ORDER BY
  supp_nation, cust_nation, l_year;
```

### 🧠 Purpose

> Measures revenue of shipments between two specific **nation pairs** (e.g., FRANCE–GERMANY), grouped by **shipment year**.

## 🦊 Mochi Version — Inline + Test

We simulate:

* Nations: FRANCE, GERMANY
* One supplier in FRANCE
* One customer in GERMANY
* Orders + lineitems that match across nations

### 🧾 **Mochi Code**

```mochi

  { n_nationkey: 1, n_name: "FRANCE" },
  { n_nationkey: 2, n_name: "GERMANY" }
]

let supplier = [
  { s_suppkey: 100, s_nationkey: 1 }
]

let customer = [
  { c_custkey: 200, c_nationkey: 2 }

let orders = [
  { o_orderkey: 1000, o_custkey: 200 }

let lineitem = [

let start_date = "1995-01-01"
let end_date = "1996-12-31"

let nation1 = "FRANCE"
let nation2 = "GERMANY"

let result =

    cust_nation: n2.n_name,
    l_year: substring(l.l_shipdate, 0, 4)
  }
  select {
    supp_nation,
    cust_nation,
    l_year,
    revenue: sum(l.l_extendedprice * (1 - l.l_discount))
  }
  order by { supp_nation, cust_nation, l_year }

print result

test "Q7 computes revenue between FRANCE and GERMANY by year" {
  expect result == [
    {
      supp_nation: "FRANCE",
      cust_nation: "GERMANY",
      l_year: "1995",
      revenue: 900.0
    }
  ]
}
```

### ✅ Explanation

| Lineitem | Year | Match? | Revenue          |
| -------- | ---- | ------ | ---------------- |
| 1        | 1995 | ✅      | 1000 × 0.9 = 900 |
| 2        | 1997 | ❌      | Out of range     |
