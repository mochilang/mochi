# TPC-H Query 18 – Large Volume Customer

In [q18.mochi](./q18.mochi) one customer places orders totalling more than the threshold quantity, while the other does not. The query returns the high-volume customer with total revenue from all of their orders.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT
  c_name,
  c_custkey,
  SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue,
  c_acctbal,
  n_name,
  c_address,
  c_phone,
  c_comment
FROM
  customer,
  orders,
  lineitem,
  nation
WHERE
  c_custkey = o_custkey
  AND o_orderkey = l_orderkey
  AND c_nationkey = n_nationkey
GROUP BY
  c_name, c_custkey, c_acctbal, c_phone, n_name, c_address, c_comment
HAVING
  SUM(l_quantity) > :threshold
ORDER BY
  revenue DESC;
```

## Expected Output
Alice's combined quantity exceeds the threshold, producing revenue `1000×0.9 + 800 = 1700`.
