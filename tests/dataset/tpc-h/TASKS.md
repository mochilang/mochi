# TPCH Test Notes

Each query in this directory has a `.mochi` implementation with inline data and a test block verifying the expected result. Earlier issues around rounding and parsing in a few programs (q8, q13, q21 and q22) have been resolved. If a test fails, re-run the query and compare the printed output with the expected result file.
