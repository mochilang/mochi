# TPC-H Query 6 – Forecasting Revenue Change

The example in [q6.mochi](./q6.mochi) evaluates revenue from discounted line items shipped in 1994 with quantities under 24. Two of the four rows meet these conditions.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT
  SUM(l_extendedprice * l_discount) AS revenue
FROM
  lineitem
WHERE
  l_shipdate >= DATE '1994-01-01'
  AND l_shipdate < DATE '1995-01-01'
  AND l_discount BETWEEN 0.05 AND 0.07
  AND l_quantity < 24;
```

## Expected Output
The qualifying rows contribute `1000×0.06 = 60` and `500×0.07 = 35`, so the sum is:
```text
95.0
```
