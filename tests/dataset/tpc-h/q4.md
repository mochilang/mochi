# TPC-H Query 4 â€“ Order Priority Check

The dataset in [q4.mochi](./q4.mochi) contains two orders within the target date range. Each has a line item where the commit date precedes the receipt date. The query counts such orders by priority.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT
  o_orderpriority,
  COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM
  orders
WHERE
  o_orderdate >= DATE ':start'
  AND o_orderdate < DATE ':end'
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT *
    FROM lineitem
    WHERE l_orderkey = o_orderkey
      AND l_commitdate < l_receiptdate
  )
GROUP BY
  o_orderpriority
ORDER BY
  o_orderpriority;
```

## Expected Output
Both priorities appear once in the example data:
```json
[
  { "o_orderpriority": "1-URGENT", "order_count": 1 },
  { "o_orderpriority": "2-HIGH",   "order_count": 1 }
]
```
