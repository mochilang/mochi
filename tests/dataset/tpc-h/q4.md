Letâ€™s proceed to **TPC-H Query 4**, again fully written in **Mochi**, with **inline data** and a **test block** to verify correctness.

## ğŸ§¾ TPC-H Query 4 â€” Order Priority Check

### âœ… **SQL Overview**

```sql
SELECT
  o_orderpriority,
  COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM
  orders
WHERE
  o_orderdate >= DATE ':start'
  AND o_orderdate < DATE ':end'
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT *
    FROM lineitem
    WHERE l_orderkey = o_orderkey
      AND l_commitdate < l_receiptdate
  )
GROUP BY
  o_orderpriority
ORDER BY
  o_orderpriority;
```

### ğŸ§  Purpose

> Count orders (grouped by priority) within a **date range**, that have **at least one late lineitem** (committed before received).

---

## ğŸ¦Š Mochi Version â€” Inline + Test

We simulate:

* 3 orders
* 5 lineitems
* Priorities: `1-URGENT`, `2-HIGH`, `3-NORMAL`

### ğŸ§¾ **Mochi Code**

```mochi
let orders = [
  { o_orderkey: 1, o_orderdate: "1993-07-01", o_orderpriority: "1-URGENT" },
  { o_orderkey: 2, o_orderdate: "1993-07-15", o_orderpriority: "2-HIGH" },
  { o_orderkey: 3, o_orderdate: "1993-08-01", o_orderpriority: "3-NORMAL" }
]

let lineitem = [
  { l_orderkey: 1, l_commitdate: "1993-07-10", l_receiptdate: "1993-07-12" }, // late
  { l_orderkey: 1, l_commitdate: "1993-07-12", l_receiptdate: "1993-07-10" }, // not late
  { l_orderkey: 2, l_commitdate: "1993-07-20", l_receiptdate: "1993-07-25" }, // late
  { l_orderkey: 3, l_commitdate: "1993-08-02", l_receiptdate: "1993-08-01" }, // not late
  { l_orderkey: 3, l_commitdate: "1993-08-05", l_receiptdate: "1993-08-10" }  // late
]

let start_date = "1993-07-01"
let end_date = "1993-08-01"

let date_filtered_orders =
  from o in orders
  where o.o_orderdate >= start_date and o.o_orderdate < end_date
  select o

let late_orders =
  from o in date_filtered_orders
  where exists l in lineitem
    where l.l_orderkey == o.o_orderkey and l.l_commitdate < l.l_receiptdate
  select o

let result =
  from o in late_orders
  group by o.o_orderpriority
  select {
    o_orderpriority: o.o_orderpriority,
    order_count: count()
  }
  order by o.o_orderpriority

print result

test "Q4 returns count of orders with late lineitems in range" {
  expect result == [
    { o_orderpriority: "1-URGENT", order_count: 1 },
    { o_orderpriority: "2-HIGH", order_count: 1 }
  ]
}
```

---

### âœ… Expected Output

| o\_orderpriority | order\_count |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| 1-URGENT         | 1            |
| 2-HIGH           | 1            |

Order 3 is **excluded** because it is **not in the date range** (`>= 1993-08-01` is **excluded** due to `< end_date`).

Would you like to continue with **Q5**, or take a quick detour to build a Mochi testing framework for all 22 queries?
