# TPC-H Query 15 – Top Supplier

[q15.mochi](./q15.mochi) defines a temporary revenue view for Q1 1996. The example line items show supplier `100` shipping goods on `1996-01-15` and `1996-03-20` with discounts of `10%` and `0%`. No other supplier ships in this window, so supplier `100` becomes the top earner.

## SQL
```sql
CREATE VIEW revenue0 (supplier_no, total_revenue) AS
SELECT
  l_suppkey,
  SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount))
FROM
  lineitem
WHERE
  l_shipdate >= DATE '1996-01-01'
  AND l_shipdate < DATE '1996-04-01'
GROUP BY
  l_suppkey;

SELECT
  s_suppkey,
  s_name,
  s_address,
  s_phone,
  total_revenue
FROM
  supplier,
  revenue0
WHERE
  s_suppkey = supplier_no
  AND total_revenue = (
    SELECT MAX(total_revenue) FROM revenue0
  )
ORDER BY
  s_suppkey;
```

## Expected Output
Supplier 100 ships both qualifying line items. The first has price `1000` with a `10%` discount, and the second has price `500` with no discount. The temporary view therefore records revenue `1000 × (1 - 0.10) + 500 = 1400` for that supplier.

[
  {
    "s_suppkey": 100,
    "s_name": "Best Supplier",
    "s_address": "123 Market St",
    "s_phone": "123-456",
    "total_revenue": 1400.0
  }
