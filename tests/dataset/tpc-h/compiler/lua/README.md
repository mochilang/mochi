# TPC-H Lua Outputs

This directory holds Lua translations of the TPC-H benchmark queries generated by the Mochi compiler. Each query is compiled and executed using the Lua interpreter. Successful runs produce a `.out` file while failures have a `.error` file.

## Query Status

The golden tests were run with Lua 5.4. Queries `q1` through `q20` execute successfully and match the expected JSON output. Queries `q21` and `q22` still fail at runtime due to boolean comparison bugs and are tracked via `.error` files.
