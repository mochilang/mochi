# TPC-H Kotlin Outputs

This directory contains Kotlin translations of the TPC-H benchmark queries generated by the Mochi compiler. Each query `qN.kt` is compiled with `kotlinc` and executed with the Java runtime. Successful runs produce a `.out` file while failures have a `.error` log.

## Query Status

- [x] q1
- [ ] q2
- [ ] q3
- [ ] q4
- [ ] q5
- [ ] q6
- [ ] q7
- [ ] q8
- [ ] q9
- [x] q10
- [ ] q11
- [ ] q12
- [ ] q13

The golden tests currently compile and run query `q1` successfully. Queries `q2`, `q3`, and `q11` fail during compilation, while `q12` and `q13` compile but the output does not match the expected results. Other queries have not yet been validated.
