# TPC-H F# Outputs

This directory contains F# code generated from the Mochi implementations of the TPC-H benchmark queries. Each query is compiled and executed using `fsharpc` and `mono`. Passing queries include a `.out` file containing the program output while failures produce an `.error` file. With the current mono runtime all queries fail to compile because the `System.Text.Json` reference cannot be resolved.

## Query Status

None of the queries compile successfully.
