# TPC-H Elixir Outputs

This directory contains Elixir translations of the TPC-H benchmark queries generated by the Mochi compiler. Each `.ex` file is executed with `elixir` during the golden tests. Queries that compile and run successfully have a corresponding `.out` file; failures produce a `.error` log.
