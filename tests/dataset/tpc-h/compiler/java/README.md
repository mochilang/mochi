# TPC-H Java Outputs

This directory contains Java translations of the TPC-H benchmark queries generated by the Mochi compiler. Each file `qN.java` is compiled with `javac` and run with `java`. When the program executes successfully, the expected output is stored in `qN.out`. Errors are recorded in `qN.error` where present.
