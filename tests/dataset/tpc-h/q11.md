# TPC-H Query 11 â€“ Important Stock Identification

The program [q11.mochi](./q11.mochi) considers suppliers from Germany and calculates the value of their available stock. Items whose value exceeds 0.01% of the total are retained.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT
  ps_partkey,
  SUM(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) AS value
FROM
  partsupp,
  supplier,
  nation
WHERE
  ps_suppkey = s_suppkey
  AND s_nationkey = n_nationkey
  AND n_name = ':nation'
GROUP BY
  ps_partkey
HAVING
  SUM(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) > (
    SELECT SUM(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) * 0.0001
    FROM
      partsupp,
      supplier,
      nation
    WHERE
      ps_suppkey = s_suppkey
      AND s_nationkey = n_nationkey
      AND n_name = ':nation'
  )
ORDER BY
  value DESC;
```

## Expected Output
The total value of German stock is `2050`; 0.01% of that is `0.205`. Both qualifying part keys therefore appear in the result.
```json
[
  { "ps_partkey": 1000, "value": 2000.0 },
  { "ps_partkey": 2000, "value": 50.0 }
]
```
