Letâ€™s now continue with **TPC-H Query 20**, which identifies **suppliers who delivered critical parts late** and are the **only ones** supplying them â€” a classic use of `EXISTS` + `NOT EXISTS`.

## ðŸ§¾ TPC-H Query 20 â€” Potential Suppliers

### âœ… **SQL Overview**

```sql
SELECT
  s_name,
  s_address
FROM
  supplier
WHERE
  s_suppkey IN (
    SELECT
      ps_suppkey
    FROM
      partsupp,
      part
    WHERE
      ps_partkey = p_partkey
      AND p_name LIKE 'forest%'
      AND ps_availqty > (
        SELECT
          0.5 * SUM(l_quantity)
        FROM
          lineitem
        WHERE
          l_partkey = ps_partkey
          AND l_suppkey = ps_suppkey
          AND l_shipdate >= DATE '1994-01-01'
          AND l_shipdate < DATE '1995-01-01'
      )
  )
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT *
    FROM nation
    WHERE s_nationkey = n_nationkey
      AND n_name = 'CANADA'
  )
ORDER BY
  s_name;
```

## ðŸ§  Purpose

> Returns suppliers from `'CANADA'` who **stock forest parts** in high quantity â€” more than **50% of what was shipped** in 1994.

---

## ðŸ¦Š Mochi Version â€” Inline + Test

We simulate:

* 1 part `"forest glade bricks"`
* 2 suppliers (1 in CANADA)
* 1 lineitem shipped in 1994

### ðŸ§¾ **Mochi Code**

  order by s.s_name
  select {
    s_name: s.s_name,
    s_address: s.s_address
  }

print result

test "Q20 returns suppliers from CANADA with forest part stock > 50% of 1994 shipments" {
  expect result == [
    { s_name: "Maple Supply", s_address: "123 Forest Lane" }
  ]

### âœ… Explanation

| Partkey | Supplier | Shipped in 1994 | 50% of Shipped | AvailQty | Match? |
| ------- | -------- | --------------- | -------------- | -------- | ------ |
| 10      | 100      | 100             | 50             | 100      | âœ…      |

â†’ Only **Maple Supply** qualifies.
