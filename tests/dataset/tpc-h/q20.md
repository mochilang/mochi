# TPC-H Query 20 â€“ Potential Suppliers

[q20.mochi](./q20.mochi) checks which Canadian suppliers hold sufficient stock of parts whose names begin with "forest". Only one supplier meets the criteria when comparing available quantity to shipments from 1994.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT
  s_name,
  s_address
FROM
  supplier
WHERE
  s_suppkey IN (
    SELECT
      ps_suppkey
    FROM
      partsupp,
      part
    WHERE
      ps_partkey = p_partkey
      AND p_name LIKE 'forest%'
      AND ps_availqty > (
        SELECT
          0.5 * SUM(l_quantity)
        FROM
          lineitem
        WHERE
          l_partkey = ps_partkey
          AND l_suppkey = ps_suppkey
          AND l_shipdate >= DATE '1994-01-01'
          AND l_shipdate < DATE '1995-01-01'
      )
  )
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT *
    FROM nation
    WHERE s_nationkey = n_nationkey
      AND n_name = 'CANADA'
  )
ORDER BY
  s_name;
```

## Expected Output
Only "Maple Supply" stocks enough of the forest part, so it is returned.
```json
[
  { "s_name": "Maple Supply", "s_address": "123 Forest Lane" }
]
```
