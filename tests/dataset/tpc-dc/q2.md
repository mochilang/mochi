# TPC-DS Query 2

This query compares weekly sales between two consecutive years. The example uses
a tiny dataset spanning two weeks. Ratios are computed between week 1 of 1998
and week 54 of 1999.

      WHERE date_dim.d_week_seq = wswscs.d_week_seq
        AND d_year = 1998) y,
     (SELECT wswscs.d_week_seq d_week_seq2,
             sun_sales sun_sales2,
             mon_sales mon_sales2,
             tue_sales tue_sales2,

             sat_sales sat_sales2
      FROM wswscs,date_dim
      WHERE date_dim.d_week_seq = wswscs.d_week_seq
        AND d_year = 1999) z
WHERE d_week_seq1 = d_week_seq2-53
ORDER BY d_week_seq1;
```

## Expected Output
Week 1 of 1998 has half the sales of the corresponding week in 1999, so all
ratios are `0.5` or `0` when no sales occurred in 1998.
