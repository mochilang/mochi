# TPC-DC Query 34 â€“ Frequent Buyer Listing

This query finds customers who repeatedly shop at stores within a set of counties and whose household demographics meet certain criteria. It targets tickets with between 15 and 20 items.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT c_last_name, c_first_name, c_salutation, c_preferred_cust_flag,
       ss_ticket_number, cnt
FROM (
  SELECT ss_ticket_number, ss_customer_sk, COUNT(*) AS cnt
  FROM store_sales
  JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
  JOIN household_demographics ON ss_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk
  WHERE (d_dom BETWEEN 1 AND 3 OR d_dom BETWEEN 25 AND 28)
    AND hd_buy_potential IN ('1001-5000','>10000','501-1000','0-500','Unknown','5001-10000')
    AND hd_vehicle_count > 0
    AND (CASE WHEN hd_vehicle_count > 0 THEN hd_dep_count / hd_vehicle_count ELSE NULL END) > 1.2
    AND d_year IN (1999,2000,2001)
    AND s_county IN ('A','B','C','D','E','F','G','H')
  GROUP BY ss_ticket_number, ss_customer_sk
) dn
JOIN customer ON ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
WHERE cnt BETWEEN 15 AND 20
ORDER BY c_last_name, c_first_name, c_salutation, c_preferred_cust_flag DESC, ss_ticket_number;
```

```json
[
  {"c_last_name": "Smith", "c_first_name": "John", "c_salutation": "Mr.", "c_preferred_cust_flag": "Y", "ss_ticket_number": 1, "cnt": 16}
