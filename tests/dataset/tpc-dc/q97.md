# TPC-DC Query 97

Query 97 compares customers who buy items in store, via catalog, or both.

## SQL
```sql
with ssci as (
  select ss_customer_sk customer_sk, ss_item_sk item_sk
  from store_sales
  group by ss_customer_sk, ss_item_sk
),
csci as (
  select cs_bill_customer_sk customer_sk, cs_item_sk item_sk
  from catalog_sales
  group by cs_bill_customer_sk, cs_item_sk
)
select sum(case when ssci.customer_sk is not null and csci.customer_sk is null then 1 else 0 end) store_only,
       sum(case when ssci.customer_sk is null and csci.customer_sk is not null then 1 else 0 end) catalog_only,
       sum(case when ssci.customer_sk is not null and csci.customer_sk is not null then 1 else 0 end) store_and_catalog
from ssci full outer join csci on ssci.customer_sk = csci.customer_sk and ssci.item_sk = csci.item_sk;
```

## Expected Output
For the simple sample data there is one customer in each category:
```json
{
  "store_only": 1,
  "catalog_only": 1,
  "store_and_catalog": 1
}
```
