 select c_customer_id
 from customer_total_return ctr1
 ,store
 ,customer
 where ctr1.ctr_total_return > (select avg(ctr_total_return)*1.2
                                from customer_total_return ctr2
                                where ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk)
 and s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk
