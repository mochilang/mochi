# TPC-DS Query 1

This example mirrors the first TPC-DS query. The tables include a few return
records for two customers at a single store. Customer `C1` has higher total
returns than the store average, so only that customer is returned.

## SQL
```sql
WITH customer_total_return AS (
  SELECT sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
         sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk,
         SUM(sr_return_amt) AS ctr_total_return
  FROM store_returns, date_dim
  WHERE sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
    AND d_year = 1998
  GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk)
SELECT c_customer_id
FROM customer_total_return ctr1, store, customer
WHERE ctr1.ctr_total_return > (
        SELECT AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2
        FROM customer_total_return ctr2
        WHERE ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk)
  AND s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk
  AND s_state = 'TN'
  AND ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
ORDER BY c_customer_id
LIMIT 100;
```

## Expected Output
Only customer `C1` exceeds the 120% average return threshold.
```json
[
  {"c_customer_id": "C1"}
]
```
