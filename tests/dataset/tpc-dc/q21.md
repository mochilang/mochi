# TPC-DC Query 21

This query checks how inventory levels change around a particular sales date.
It calculates the quantity on hand for each warehouse and item before and after
the date and filters rows where the ratio stays within reasonable bounds.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT w_warehouse_name,
         i_item_id,
         SUM(CASE WHEN d_date < DATE '2000-03-15' THEN inv_quantity_on_hand ELSE 0 END) AS inv_before,
         SUM(CASE WHEN d_date >= DATE '2000-03-15' THEN inv_quantity_on_hand ELSE 0 END) AS inv_after
  FROM inventory, warehouse, item, date_dim
  WHERE inv_item_sk = i_item_sk
    AND inv_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk
    AND inv_date_sk = d_date_sk
    AND i_current_price BETWEEN 0.99 AND 1.49
    AND d_date BETWEEN DATE '2000-02-15' AND DATE '2000-03-20'
  GROUP BY w_warehouse_name, i_item_id
) x
WHERE CASE WHEN inv_before > 0 THEN inv_after / inv_before ELSE NULL END BETWEEN 2.0/3.0 AND 3.0/2.0
ORDER BY w_warehouse_name, i_item_id;
```

## Expected Output
Two items in the Main warehouse satisfy the ratio condition.
```json
[
  { "w_warehouse_name": "Main", "i_item_id": "ITEM1", "inv_before": 30, "inv_after": 40 },
  { "w_warehouse_name": "Main", "i_item_id": "ITEM3", "inv_before": 60, "inv_after": 90 }
]
```
