# TPC-DC Query 10 – Returned Item Reporting

In [q10.mochi](./q10.mochi) a single customer has two orders, but only one order item is returned within the 1993‑10 to 1994‑01 window. The query sums the revenue from those returned items.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT
  c_custkey,
  c_name,
  SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue,
  c_acctbal,
  n_name,
  c_address,
  c_phone,
  c_comment
FROM
  customer,
  orders,
  lineitem,
  nation
WHERE
  c_custkey = o_custkey
  AND l_orderkey = o_orderkey
  AND o_orderdate >= DATE '1993-10-01'
  AND o_orderdate < DATE '1994-01-01'
  AND l_returnflag = 'R'
  AND c_nationkey = n_nationkey
GROUP BY
  c_custkey, c_name, c_acctbal, c_phone, n_name, c_address, c_comment
ORDER BY
  revenue DESC;
```

## Expected Output
Only the first order matches all conditions, producing revenue `1000×0.9 = 900`.
```json
[
  {
    "c_custkey": 1,
    "c_name": "Alice",
    "revenue": 900.0,
    "c_acctbal": 100.0,
    "n_name": "BRAZIL",
    "c_address": "123 St",
    "c_phone": "123-456",
    "c_comment": "Loyal"
  }
]
```
