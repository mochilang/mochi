# TPC-DC Query 16 – Parts/Supplier Exclusion

The data in [q16.mochi](./q16.mochi) contains two suppliers. One supplies the specified part and the other has a comment referencing customer complaints, so neither qualifies.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT
  s_name,
  s_address
FROM
  supplier
WHERE
  s_suppkey NOT IN (
    SELECT
      ps_suppkey
    FROM
      partsupp,
      part
    WHERE
      ps_partkey = p_partkey
      AND p_brand = ':brand'
      AND p_type LIKE ':type%'
      AND p_size = :size
  )
  AND s_comment NOT LIKE '%Customer%Complaints%'
ORDER BY
  s_name;
```

## Expected Output
No supplier meets all criteria, so the result is an empty list.
```json
[]
```
