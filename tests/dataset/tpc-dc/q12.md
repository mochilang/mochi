# TPC-DC Query 12 – Shipping Modes and Delays

The dataset in [q12.mochi](./q12.mochi) contains two shipments. Only one meets the late-shipment criteria, and it uses the `MAIL` mode with urgent priority.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT
  l_shipmode,
  SUM(CASE WHEN o_orderpriority = '1-URGENT' OR o_orderpriority = '2-HIGH' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS high_line_count,
  SUM(CASE WHEN o_orderpriority <> '1-URGENT' AND o_orderpriority <> '2-HIGH' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS low_line_count
FROM
  orders,
  lineitem
WHERE
  o_orderkey = l_orderkey
  AND l_shipmode IN ('MAIL', 'SHIP')
  AND l_commitdate < l_receiptdate
  AND l_shipdate < l_commitdate
  AND l_receiptdate >= DATE '1994-01-01'
  AND l_receiptdate < DATE '1995-01-01'
GROUP BY
  l_shipmode
ORDER BY
  l_shipmode;
```

## Expected Output
The single qualifying row falls under `MAIL` and urgent priority.
```json
[
  { "l_shipmode": "MAIL", "high_line_count": 1, "low_line_count": 0 }
]
```
