## SQL
```sql
[LIMITA]  select [LIMITB] i_brand_id brand_id, i_brand brand,
        sum(ss_ext_sales_price) ext_price
 from date_dim, store_sales, item
 where d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
        and ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
        and i_manager_id=[MANAGER]
        and d_moy=[MONTH]
        and d_year=[YEAR]
 group by i_brand, i_brand_id
 order by ext_price desc, i_brand_id
[LIMITC] ;
```

## Expected Output
