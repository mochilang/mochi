# TPC-DS Query 7

This query computes average sales metrics for a demographic group. The sample dataset contains a single sale, producing straightforward averages.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT i_item_id,
       AVG(ss_quantity) AS agg1,
       AVG(ss_list_price) AS agg2,
       AVG(ss_coupon_amt) AS agg3,
       AVG(ss_sales_price) AS agg4
FROM store_sales,
     customer_demographics,
     date_dim,
     item,
     promotion
WHERE ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  AND ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
  AND ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
  AND ss_promo_sk = p_promo_sk
  AND cd_gender = 'M'
  AND cd_marital_status = 'S'
  AND cd_education_status = 'College'
  AND (p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N')
  AND d_year = 1998
GROUP BY i_item_id
ORDER BY i_item_id
LIMIT 100;
```

## Expected Output
All averages equal the values of the lone sale.
```json
[
  {"i_item_id": "I1", "agg1": 10.0, "agg2": 20.0, "agg3": 2.0, "agg4": 18.0}
]
```
