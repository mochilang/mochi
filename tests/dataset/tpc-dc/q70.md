## SQL
```sql

    sum(ss_net_profit) as total_sum, s_state, s_county
   ,grouping(s_state)+grouping(s_county) as lochierarchy
   ,rank() over (
            partition by grouping(s_state)+grouping(s_county),
            case when grouping(s_county) = 0 then s_state end
            order by sum(ss_net_profit) desc) as rank_within_parent
 from
    store_sales, date_dim d1, store
 where
    d1.d_month_seq between 1200 and 1200+11
 and d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
 and s_store_sk  = ss_store_sk
 and s_state in
    (select s_state from
        (select s_state as s_state,
                              rank() over ( partition by s_state order by sum(ss_net_profit) desc) as ranking
         from store_sales, store, date_dim
         where  d_month_seq between 1200 and 1200+11
                           and d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
                           and s_store_sk  = ss_store_sk
         group by s_state) tmp1
     where ranking <= 5)
 group by rollup(s_state,s_county)
 order by
   lochierarchy desc
  ,case when lochierarchy = 0 then s_state end
  ,rank_within_parent
 limit 100
```

## Expected Output
The sample dataset aggregates profit by state and county.
```json
[
  { "s_state": "CA", "s_county": "Orange", "total_sum": 15.0 },
  { "s_state": "TX", "s_county": "Harris", "total_sum": 30.0 },
  { "s_state": "TX", "s_county": "Travis", "total_sum": 20.0 }
]
```
