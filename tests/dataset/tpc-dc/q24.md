# TPC-DC Query 24

Query 24 totals the amount paid by customers after matching store sales with
their corresponding returns. It filters on item color and market before
comparing each customer's payment against the overall average.

## SQL
```sql
WITH ssales AS (
  SELECT c_last_name,
         c_first_name,
         s_store_name,
         i_color,
         SUM(ss_net_paid) AS netpaid
  FROM store_sales, store_returns, store, item, customer, customer_address
  WHERE ss_ticket_number = sr_ticket_number
    AND ss_item_sk = sr_item_sk
    AND ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
    AND ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
    AND ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
    AND c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    AND c_birth_country <> UPPER(ca_country)
    AND s_zip = ca_zip
    AND s_market_id = 5
  GROUP BY c_last_name,c_first_name,s_store_name,i_color
)
SELECT c_last_name,c_first_name,s_store_name,SUM(netpaid) paid
FROM ssales
WHERE i_color = 'RED'
GROUP BY c_last_name,c_first_name,s_store_name
HAVING SUM(netpaid) > (SELECT 0.05 * AVG(netpaid) FROM ssales)
ORDER BY c_last_name,c_first_name,s_store_name;
```

## Expected Output
Only one customer in the example meets the threshold.
```json
[
  { "c_last_name": "Smith", "c_first_name": "Ann", "s_store_name": "Store1", "paid": 180.0 }
]
```
