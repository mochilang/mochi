# TPC-DC Query 28

Query 28 analyzes store sales by splitting rows into quantity ranges and
reporting statistics for each bucket.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT AVG(ss_list_price) AS B1_LP,
         COUNT(ss_list_price) AS B1_CNT,
         COUNT(DISTINCT ss_list_price) AS B1_CNTD
  FROM store_sales
  WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 0 AND 5
    AND (ss_list_price BETWEEN 0 AND 10
         OR ss_coupon_amt BETWEEN 0 AND 1000
         OR ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 0 AND 20)
) B1,
(
  SELECT AVG(ss_list_price) AS B2_LP,
         COUNT(ss_list_price) AS B2_CNT,
         COUNT(DISTINCT ss_list_price) AS B2_CNTD
  FROM store_sales
  WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 6 AND 10
    AND (ss_list_price BETWEEN 0 AND 10
         OR ss_coupon_amt BETWEEN 0 AND 1000
         OR ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 0 AND 20)
) B2;
```

## Expected Output
Only two buckets are populated in the sample data.
```json
{
  "B1_LP": 95.0,
  "B1_CNT": 2,
  "B1_CNTD": 2,
  "B2_LP": 82.5,
  "B2_CNT": 2,
  "B2_CNTD": 2
