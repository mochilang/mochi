# TPC-DC Query 26

Query 26 calculates averages of quantity, list price, coupon amount and sales
price for catalog sales targeting a specific demographic segment.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT i_item_id,
       AVG(cs_quantity)     AS agg1,
       AVG(cs_list_price)   AS agg2,
       AVG(cs_coupon_amt)   AS agg3,
       AVG(cs_sales_price)  AS agg4
FROM catalog_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, item, promotion
WHERE cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  AND cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
  AND cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
  AND cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk
  AND cd_gender = 'M'
  AND cd_marital_status = 'S'
  AND cd_education_status = 'College'
  AND (p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N')
  AND d_year = 2000
GROUP BY i_item_id;
```

## Expected Output
Our sample data returns one row with averages equal to the raw values.
```json
[
  { "i_item_id": "ITEM1", "agg1": 10.0, "agg2": 100.0, "agg3": 5.0, "agg4": 95.0 }
]
```
