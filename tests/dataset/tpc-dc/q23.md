# TPC-DC Query 23

Query 23 identifies items that sell frequently in stores and then finds the most
profitable customers for those products. It sums sales from both catalog and web
channels for a single month.

## SQL
```sql
WITH frequent_ss_items AS (
  SELECT i_item_sk
  FROM store_sales, date_dim, item
  WHERE ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    AND ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
    AND d_year = 2000
  GROUP BY i_item_sk, d_date
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 4
), best_ss_customer AS (
  SELECT ss_customer_sk
  FROM store_sales
  GROUP BY ss_customer_sk
  HAVING SUM(ss_quantity * ss_sales_price) > 0.95 * (
    SELECT MAX(csales) FROM (
      SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(ss_quantity * ss_sales_price) csales
      FROM store_sales GROUP BY ss_customer_sk
    ) m
  )
)
SELECT SUM(sales) AS sales
FROM (
  SELECT cs_quantity * cs_list_price AS sales
  FROM catalog_sales, date_dim
  WHERE cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    AND d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 1
    AND cs_bill_customer_sk IN (SELECT ss_customer_sk FROM best_ss_customer)
    AND cs_item_sk IN (SELECT i_item_sk FROM frequent_ss_items)
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ws_quantity * ws_list_price
  FROM web_sales, date_dim
  WHERE ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    AND d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 1
    AND ws_bill_customer_sk IN (SELECT ss_customer_sk FROM best_ss_customer)
    AND ws_item_sk IN (SELECT i_item_sk FROM frequent_ss_items)
) x;
```

## Expected Output
Additional rows increase the total sales to 130 in the example dataset.
```json
130.0
