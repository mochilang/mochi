# TPC-DC Query 33 â€“ Sales by Manufacturer

This query sums sales across store, catalog and web channels for items in a given category, month and year at a specific time zone offset. Manufacturers are ranked by total sales. The dataset also contains a few extra sales from another month that are ignored by the filter.

## SQL
```sql
WITH ss AS (
  SELECT i_manufact_id, SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
  FROM store_sales
  JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  JOIN customer_address ON ss_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
  JOIN item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
  WHERE i_category IN ('Books','Home','Electronics','Jewelry','Sports')
    AND d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 1 AND ca_gmt_offset = -5
  GROUP BY i_manufact_id
),
cs AS (
  SELECT i_manufact_id, SUM(cs_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
  FROM catalog_sales
  JOIN date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  JOIN customer_address ON cs_bill_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
  JOIN item ON cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
  WHERE i_category IN ('Books','Home','Electronics','Jewelry','Sports')
    AND d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 1 AND ca_gmt_offset = -5
  GROUP BY i_manufact_id
),
ws AS (
  SELECT i_manufact_id, SUM(ws_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
  FROM web_sales
  JOIN date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  JOIN customer_address ON ws_bill_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
  JOIN item ON ws_item_sk = i_item_sk
  WHERE i_category IN ('Books','Home','Electronics','Jewelry','Sports')
    AND d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 1 AND ca_gmt_offset = -5
  GROUP BY i_manufact_id
)
SELECT i_manufact_id, SUM(total_sales) AS total_sales
FROM (
  SELECT * FROM ss
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM cs
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM ws
) t
GROUP BY i_manufact_id
ORDER BY total_sales;
```

## Expected Output
The simplified example in [q33.mochi](./q33.mochi) lists manufacturers ordered by total sales for the sample data:
```json
[
  {"i_manufact_id": 1, "total_sales": 225.0},
  {"i_manufact_id": 2, "total_sales": 125.0}
]
```
