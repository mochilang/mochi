# TPC-DS Query 8

This query calculates net profit per store for customers living in selected ZIP codes. The sample dataset contains one qualifying sale.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT s_store_name,
       SUM(ss_net_profit)
FROM store_sales,
     date_dim,
     store,
     (SELECT ca_zip
      FROM (
        SELECT SUBSTR(ca_zip,1,5) AS ca_zip
        FROM customer_address
        WHERE SUBSTR(ca_zip,1,5) IN ('12345','23456','34567','45678','56789')
        INTERSECT
        SELECT ca_zip
        FROM (SELECT SUBSTR(ca_zip,1,5) AS ca_zip, COUNT(*) cnt
              FROM customer_address, customer
              WHERE ca_address_sk = c_current_addr_sk
                AND c_preferred_cust_flag='Y'
              GROUP BY ca_zip
              HAVING COUNT(*) > 10) A1) A2) V1
WHERE ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
  AND ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  AND d_qoy = 1 AND d_year = 1998
  AND SUBSTR(s_zip,1,2) = SUBSTR(V1.ca_zip,1,2)
GROUP BY s_store_name
ORDER BY s_store_name
LIMIT 100;
```

## Expected Output
The single sale contributes all net profit for store `Main`.
```json
[
  {"s_store_name": "Main", "sum_profit": 100.0}
]
```
