# TPC-DS Query 6

This query counts customers by state for items priced above average in a given month. The sample data includes two customers from different states who purchase items with prices above and below the overall average.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT a.ca_state AS state, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM customer_address a,
     customer c,
     store_sales s,
     date_dim d,
     item i
WHERE a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk
  AND c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk
  AND s.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
  AND s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
  AND d.d_month_seq = (
        SELECT DISTINCT d_month_seq
        FROM date_dim
        WHERE d_year = 1999 AND d_moy = 5)
  AND i.i_current_price > 1.2 * (
        SELECT AVG(j.i_current_price)
        FROM item j
        WHERE j.i_category = i.i_category)
GROUP BY a.ca_state
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10
ORDER BY cnt, a.ca_state
LIMIT 100;
```

## Expected Output
Only the Texas customer bought an item priced above the overall average.
```json
[
  {"state": "TX", "cnt": 1}
]
