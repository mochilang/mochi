# TPC-DC Query 95

Query 95 is similar to Q94 but restricts to orders that were returned and shipped from multiple warehouses.

## SQL
```sql
with ws_wh as (
  select ws1.ws_order_number
  from web_sales ws1, web_sales ws2
  where ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number
    and ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk
)
select count(distinct ws_order_number) as "order count",
       sum(ws_ext_ship_cost) as "total shipping cost",
       sum(ws_net_profit) as "total net profit"
from web_sales ws1
  join date_dim d on ws1.ws_ship_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
  join customer_address ca on ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
  join web_site w on ws1.ws_web_site_sk = w.web_site_sk
where d.d_date between '2001-02-01' and date('2001-02-01') + interval '60' day
  and ca.ca_state = 'CA'
  and w.web_company_name = 'pri'
  and ws1.ws_order_number in (select ws_order_number from ws_wh)
  and ws1.ws_order_number in (select wr_order_number from web_returns)
order by 1;
```

## Expected Output
The sample includes one qualifying returned order:
```json
{
  "order_count": 1,
  "total_shipping_cost": 2.0,
  "total_net_profit": 5.0
}
```
