# JOB Query 9

This example implements the JOB query from [`9a.sql`](https://github.com/gregrahn/join-order-benchmark/blob/master/9a.sql). The dataset contains one qualifying voice actress credited in an American production between 2005 and 2015.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT MIN(an.name) AS alternative_name,
       MIN(chn.name) AS character_name,
       MIN(t.title) AS movie
FROM aka_name AS an,
     char_name AS chn,
     cast_info AS ci,
     company_name AS cn,
     movie_companies AS mc,
     name AS n,
     role_type AS rt,
     title AS t
WHERE ci.note IN ('(voice)',
                  '(voice: Japanese version)',
                  '(voice) (uncredited)',
                  '(voice: English version)')
  AND cn.country_code ='[us]'
  AND mc.note IS NOT NULL
  AND (mc.note LIKE '%(USA)%'
       OR mc.note LIKE '%(worldwide)%')
  AND n.gender ='f'
  AND n.name LIKE '%Ang%'
  AND rt.role ='actress'
  AND t.production_year BETWEEN 2005 AND 2015
  AND ci.movie_id = t.id
  AND t.id = mc.movie_id
  AND ci.movie_id = mc.movie_id
  AND mc.company_id = cn.id
  AND ci.role_id = rt.id
  AND n.id = ci.person_id
  AND chn.id = ci.person_role_id
  AND an.person_id = n.id
  AND an.person_id = ci.person_id;
```

## Expected Output
Only the actress named *Angelina* with alias *Angela Alias* meets all conditions. She voices the character *Angel* in the movie *My Animated Film*.
```json
[
  {
    "alternative_name": "Angela Alias",
