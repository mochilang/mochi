# Join Order Benchmark Query 4 â€“ Highest Rated Sequels

[q4.mochi](./q4.mochi) models a small portion of the IMDB schema. Only one movie in the sample data is a sequel released after 2005 with a rating above 5.0. The query returns the minimum rating and title among all such movies.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT MIN(mi_idx.info) AS rating,
       MIN(t.title) AS movie_title
FROM info_type AS it,
     keyword AS k,
     movie_info_idx AS mi_idx,
     movie_keyword AS mk,
     title AS t
WHERE it.info ='rating'
  AND k.keyword LIKE '%sequel%'
  AND mi_idx.info > '5.0'
  AND t.production_year > 2005
  AND t.id = mi_idx.movie_id
  AND t.id = mk.movie_id
  AND mk.movie_id = mi_idx.movie_id
  AND k.id = mk.keyword_id
  AND it.id = mi_idx.info_type_id;
```

## Expected Output
With the example data the only qualifying movie is "Action Movie 2" rated 6.3:
```json
{ "rating": 6.3, "movie_title": "Action Movie 2" }
```
