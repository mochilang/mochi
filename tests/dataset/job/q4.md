# JOB Query 4 â€“ Recent Sequel Ratings

[q4.mochi](./q4.mochi) implements query 4 from the Join Order Benchmark. It
searches for movies produced after 2005 whose keywords contain "sequel" and have
a rating higher than 5.0. The example data yields two qualifying movies and the
program returns the lowest rating and title.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT MIN(mi_idx.info) AS rating,
       MIN(t.title) AS movie_title
FROM info_type AS it,
     keyword AS k,
     movie_info_idx AS mi_idx,
     movie_keyword AS mk,
     title AS t
WHERE it.info ='rating'
  AND k.keyword LIKE '%sequel%'
  AND mi_idx.info > '5.0'
  AND t.production_year > 2005
  AND t.id = mi_idx.movie_id
  AND t.id = mk.movie_id
  AND mk.movie_id = mi_idx.movie_id
  AND k.id = mk.keyword_id
  AND it.id = mi_idx.info_type_id;
```

## Expected Output
With two qualifying movies `"Alpha Movie"` and `"Beta Film"`, the smallest
rating and title are returned:
```json
[
  { "rating": "6.2", "movie_title": "Alpha Movie" }
]
```
