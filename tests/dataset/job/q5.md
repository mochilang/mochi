# JOB Query 5 â€“ Typical European Movie

The Mochi program [q5.mochi](./q5.mochi) searches for movies produced after 2005 by
European production companies. It filters `movie_companies` records containing both
"(theatrical)" and "(France)" in the note and restricts `movie_info` rows to a set
of European languages and countries. The query returns the lexicographically
smallest title among all matching movies.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT MIN(t.title) AS typical_european_movie
FROM company_type AS ct,
     info_type AS it,
     movie_companies AS mc,
     movie_info AS mi,
     title AS t
WHERE ct.kind = 'production companies'
  AND mc.note LIKE '%(theatrical)%'
  AND mc.note LIKE '%(France)%'
  AND mi.info IN ('Sweden',
                  'Norway',
                  'Germany',
                  'Denmark',
                  'Swedish',
                  'Denish',
                  'Norwegian',
                  'German')
  AND t.production_year > 2005
  AND t.id = mi.movie_id
  AND t.id = mc.movie_id
  AND mc.movie_id = mi.movie_id
  AND ct.id = mc.company_type_id
  AND it.id = mi.info_type_id;
```

## Expected Output
With two qualifying movies (`"A Film"` and `"B Movie"`) the minimum title is
returned:
```json
[
  { "typical_european_movie": "A Film" }
]
```
