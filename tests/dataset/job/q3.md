# JOB Query 3 â€“ Sequel Movies After 2005

[q3.mochi](./q3.mochi) implements the third Join Order Benchmark query on a tiny dataset. It finds the lexicographically smallest title of movies produced after 2005 in certain European countries where the associated keyword contains `"sequel"`.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT MIN(t.title) AS movie_title
FROM keyword AS k,
     movie_info AS mi,
     movie_keyword AS mk,
     title AS t
WHERE k.keyword LIKE '%sequel%'
  AND mi.info IN ('Sweden',
                  'Norway',
                  'Germany',
                  'Denmark',
                  'Swedish',
                  'Denish',
                  'Norwegian',
                  'German')
  AND t.production_year > 2005
  AND t.id = mi.movie_id
  AND t.id = mk.movie_id
  AND mk.movie_id = mi.movie_id
  AND k.id = mk.keyword_id;
```

## Expected Output
With two qualifying titles `Alpha` and `Beta` the minimum is `Alpha`:
```json
[
  { "movie_title": "Alpha" }
]
```
