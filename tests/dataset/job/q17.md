# JOB Query 17 â€“ Character-Named American Movies

[q17.mochi](./q17.mochi) demonstrates query 17 from the Join Order Benchmark. It searches for actors whose names begin with `B` that appear in a U.S. movie tagged with the keyword `character-name-in-title`. The query returns the alphabetically first matching actor name twice, mirroring the original SQL.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT MIN(n.name) AS member_in_charnamed_american_movie,
       MIN(n.name) AS a1
FROM cast_info AS ci,
     company_name AS cn,
     keyword AS k,
     movie_companies AS mc,
     movie_keyword AS mk,
     name AS n,
     title AS t
WHERE cn.country_code ='[us]'
  AND k.keyword ='character-name-in-title'
  AND n.name LIKE 'B%'
  AND n.id = ci.person_id
  AND ci.movie_id = t.id
  AND t.id = mk.movie_id
  AND mk.keyword_id = k.id
  AND t.id = mc.movie_id
  AND mc.company_id = cn.id
  AND ci.movie_id = mc.movie_id
  AND ci.movie_id = mk.movie_id
  AND mc.movie_id = mk.movie_id;
```

## Expected Output
Only one actor satisfies all conditions in the sample data:
```json
[
  { "member_in_charnamed_american_movie": "Bob Smith", "a1": "Bob Smith" }
]
```
