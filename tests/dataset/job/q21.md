# JOB Query 21 â€“ Western Follow-Up Sequels

[q21.mochi](./q21.mochi) models a small portion of the IMDB schema to illustrate query 21 from the Join Order Benchmark. It searches for movies produced between 1950 and 2000 in northern European countries. Qualifying movies must be sequels with a link type containing "follow", produced by companies whose name includes "Film" or "Warner" (and are not from Poland) and whose company record has a null note.
