# JOB Query 16 â€“ Character-Named Series Episodes

[q16.mochi](./q16.mochi) implements query 16 from the Join Order Benchmark. The
program defines a small subset of the IMDB tables. Only one US production has an
episode number between 50 and 99 whose keyword is `character-name-in-title`, so
the query returns that actor pseudonym and series title.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT MIN(an.name) AS cool_actor_pseudonym,
       MIN(t.title) AS series_named_after_char
FROM aka_name AS an,
     cast_info AS ci,
     company_name AS cn,
     keyword AS k,
     movie_companies AS mc,
     movie_keyword AS mk,
     name AS n,
     title AS t
WHERE cn.country_code ='[us]'
  AND k.keyword ='character-name-in-title'
  AND t.episode_nr >= 50
  AND t.episode_nr < 100
  AND an.person_id = n.id
  AND n.id = ci.person_id
  AND ci.movie_id = t.id
  AND t.id = mk.movie_id
  AND mk.keyword_id = k.id
  AND t.id = mc.movie_id
  AND mc.company_id = cn.id
  AND an.person_id = ci.person_id
  AND ci.movie_id = mc.movie_id
  AND ci.movie_id = mk.movie_id
  AND mc.movie_id = mk.movie_id;
```

## Expected Output
With the minimal dataset a single row satisfies all conditions.
```json
[
  { "cool_actor_pseudonym": "Alpha", "series_named_after_char": "Hero Bob" }
]
```
