# JOB Query 1 â€“ Production Companies for Top Movies

The program in [q1.mochi](./q1.mochi) demonstrates a simplified version of the first Join Order Benchmark query. It searches for movies ranked in the IMDB Top 250 whose production company note contains either `(co-production)` or `(presents)` but does not contain `(as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures)`. It returns the minimum note, title and year of all qualifying rows.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT MIN(mc.note) AS production_note,
       MIN(t.title) AS movie_title,
       MIN(t.production_year) AS movie_year
FROM company_type AS ct,
     info_type AS it,
     movie_companies AS mc,
     movie_info_idx AS mi_idx,
     title AS t
WHERE ct.kind = 'production companies'
  AND it.info = 'top 250 rank'
  AND mc.note NOT LIKE '%(as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures)%'
  AND (mc.note LIKE '%(co-production)%'
       OR mc.note LIKE '%(presents)%')
  AND ct.id = mc.company_type_id
  AND t.id = mc.movie_id
  AND t.id = mi_idx.movie_id
  AND mc.movie_id = mi_idx.movie_id
  AND it.id = mi_idx.info_type_id;
```

## Expected Output
With the sample data only one row satisfies all conditions, so the minimum values correspond to that entry:
```json
{
  "production_note": "ACME (co-production)",
  "movie_title": "Good Movie",
  "movie_year": 1995
}
```
