# JOB Query 7 â€“ Mini Biography Features

This example corresponds to query 7 from the Join Order Benchmark. The program
in [q7.mochi](./q7.mochi) searches for people with a mini biography noted by
"Volker Boehm" whose names fall in a specific alphabet range and appear in
movies linked as features between 1980 and 1995. Only one row in the sample
data satisfies all predicates.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT MIN(n.name) AS of_person,
       MIN(t.title) AS biography_movie
FROM aka_name AS an,
     cast_info AS ci,
     info_type AS it,
     link_type AS lt,
     movie_link AS ml,
     name AS n,
     person_info AS pi,
     title AS t
WHERE an.name LIKE '%a%'
  AND it.info = 'mini biography'
  AND lt.link = 'features'
  AND n.name_pcode_cf BETWEEN 'A' AND 'F'
  AND (n.gender = 'm'
       OR (n.gender = 'f' AND n.name LIKE 'B%'))
  AND pi.note = 'Volker Boehm'
  AND t.production_year BETWEEN 1980 AND 1995
  AND n.id = an.person_id
  AND n.id = pi.person_id
  AND ci.person_id = n.id
  AND t.id = ci.movie_id
  AND ml.linked_movie_id = t.id
  AND lt.id = ml.link_type_id
  AND it.id = pi.info_type_id
  AND pi.person_id = an.person_id
  AND pi.person_id = ci.person_id
  AND an.person_id = ci.person_id
  AND ci.movie_id = ml.linked_movie_id;
```

## Expected Output
With the small dataset, the only qualifying record refers to *Alan Brown* and
the movie *Feature Film*.
```json
[
  {
    "of_person": "Alan Brown",
    "biography_movie": "Feature Film"
  }
]
```
