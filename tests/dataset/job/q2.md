# JOB Query 2 â€“ Character Name Titles by German Companies

[q2.mochi](./q2.mochi) implements one variant of JOB query 2. The program models a
few movies and related metadata. Only the movie produced by the German company
matches the `character-name-in-title` keyword, so its title is returned as the
minimum.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT MIN(t.title) AS movie_title
FROM company_name AS cn,
     keyword AS k,
     movie_companies AS mc,
     movie_keyword AS mk,
     title AS t
WHERE cn.country_code ='[de]'
  AND k.keyword ='character-name-in-title'
  AND cn.id = mc.company_id
  AND mc.movie_id = t.id
  AND t.id = mk.movie_id
  AND mk.keyword_id = k.id
  AND mc.movie_id = mk.movie_id;
```

## Expected Output
Only one film satisfies all conditions, so the query yields its title:
```json
"Der Film"
```
