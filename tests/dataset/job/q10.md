# JOB Query 10 â€“ Uncredited Voice Actor in Russian Movies

In [q10.mochi](./q10.mochi) a Russian movie produced after 2005 features an actor credited as "(voice) (uncredited)". The query returns the smallest character name and movie title that satisfy these conditions.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT MIN(chn.name) AS uncredited_voiced_character,
       MIN(t.title) AS russian_movie
FROM char_name AS chn,
     cast_info AS ci,
     company_name AS cn,
     company_type AS ct,
     movie_companies AS mc,
     role_type AS rt,
     title AS t
WHERE ci.note LIKE '%(voice)%'
  AND ci.note LIKE '%(uncredited)%'
  AND cn.country_code = '[ru]'
  AND rt.role = 'actor'
  AND t.production_year > 2005
  AND t.id = mc.movie_id
  AND t.id = ci.movie_id
  AND ci.movie_id = mc.movie_id
  AND chn.id = ci.person_role_id
  AND rt.id = ci.role_id
  AND cn.id = mc.company_id
  AND ct.id = mc.company_type_id;
```

## Expected Output
Only the first row in the sample data matches all filters, so the result contains that character and movie:
```json
[
  {"uncredited_voiced_character": "Ivan", "russian_movie": "Vodka Dreams"}
]
```
