# JOB Query 19 â€“ Voicing Actress for 2000s Releases

[q19.mochi](./q19.mochi) illustrates query 19 from the Join Order Benchmark. It searches a reduced IMDB schema for female performers whose names contain "Ang" that provided voice work on movies released in the USA or Japan in the mid 2000s. Only a single record matches in the sample data.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT MIN(n.name) AS voicing_actress,
       MIN(t.title) AS voiced_movie
FROM aka_name AS an,
     char_name AS chn,
     cast_info AS ci,
     company_name AS cn,
     info_type AS it,
     movie_companies AS mc,
     movie_info AS mi,
     name AS n,
     role_type AS rt,
     title AS t
WHERE ci.note IN ('(voice)',
                  '(voice: Japanese version)',
                  '(voice) (uncredited)',
                  '(voice: English version)')
  AND cn.country_code = '[us]'
  AND it.info = 'release dates'
  AND mc.note IS NOT NULL
  AND (mc.note LIKE '%(USA)%'
       OR mc.note LIKE '%(worldwide)%')
  AND mi.info IS NOT NULL
  AND (mi.info LIKE 'Japan:%200%'
       OR mi.info LIKE 'USA:%200%')
  AND n.gender = 'f'
  AND n.name LIKE '%Ang%'
  AND rt.role = 'actress'
  AND t.production_year BETWEEN 2005 AND 2009
  AND t.id = mi.movie_id
  AND t.id = mc.movie_id
  AND t.id = ci.movie_id
  AND mc.movie_id = ci.movie_id
  AND mc.movie_id = mi.movie_id
  AND mi.movie_id = ci.movie_id
  AND cn.id = mc.company_id
  AND it.id = mi.info_type_id
  AND n.id = ci.person_id
  AND rt.id = ci.role_id
  AND n.id = an.person_id
  AND ci.person_id = an.person_id
  AND chn.id = ci.person_role_id;
```

## Expected Output
Only one row fits all restrictions so the minimum values are from that entry:
```json
[
  { "voicing_actress": "Angela Stone", "voiced_movie": "Voiced Movie" }
]
```
