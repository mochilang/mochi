# JOB Query 22 â€“ Western Violent Movies

[q22.mochi](./q22.mochi) demonstrates Join Order Benchmark query 22. The sample
data models a handful of movies produced by different companies. Only one
non-U.S. production from 2009 matches all predicates for violent keywords,
country information, rating below 7.0 and a note containing a 200x year. The
query returns the minimum company name, rating and title of the qualifying
movie.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT MIN(cn.name) AS movie_company,
       MIN(mi_idx.info) AS rating,
       MIN(t.title) AS western_violent_movie
FROM company_name AS cn,
     company_type AS ct,
     info_type AS it1,
     info_type AS it2,
     keyword AS k,
     kind_type AS kt,
     movie_companies AS mc,
     movie_info AS mi,
     movie_info_idx AS mi_idx,
     movie_keyword AS mk,
     title AS t
WHERE cn.country_code != '[us]'
  AND it1.info = 'countries'
  AND it2.info = 'rating'
  AND k.keyword IN ('murder',
                    'murder-in-title',
                    'blood',
                    'violence')
  AND kt.kind IN ('movie',
                  'episode')
  AND mc.note NOT LIKE '%(USA)%'
  AND mc.note LIKE '%(200%)%'
  AND mi.info IN ('Germany',
                  'German',
                  'USA',
                  'American')
  AND mi_idx.info < '7.0'
  AND t.production_year > 2008
  AND kt.id = t.kind_id
  AND t.id = mi.movie_id
  AND t.id = mk.movie_id
  AND t.id = mi_idx.movie_id
  AND t.id = mc.movie_id
  AND mk.movie_id = mi.movie_id
  AND mk.movie_id = mi_idx.movie_id
  AND mk.movie_id = mc.movie_id
  AND mi.movie_id = mi_idx.movie_id
  AND mi.movie_id = mc.movie_id
  AND mc.movie_id = mi_idx.movie_id
  AND k.id = mk.keyword_id
  AND it1.id = mi.info_type_id
  AND it2.id = mi_idx.info_type_id
  AND ct.id = mc.company_type_id
  AND cn.id = mc.company_id;
```

## Expected Output
The sample data contains a single qualifying film, so the query yields:
```json
[
  {
    "movie_company": "Euro Films",
    "rating": 6.5,
    "western_violent_movie": "Violent Western"
  }
]
```
