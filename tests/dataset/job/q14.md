# JOB Query 14 – Northern Dark Movies

[q14.mochi](./q14.mochi) defines three movies with country, rating, and keyword information. Two of them are recent productions from approved countries with ratings below `8.5` and dark keywords like `murder` or `blood`. The query returns the minimum rating and lexicographically first title among all qualifying movies.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT MIN(mi_idx.info) AS rating,
       MIN(t.title) AS northern_dark_movie
FROM info_type AS it1,
     info_type AS it2,
     keyword AS k,
     kind_type AS kt,
     movie_info AS mi,
     movie_info_idx AS mi_idx,
     movie_keyword AS mk,
     title AS t
WHERE it1.info = 'countries'
  AND it2.info = 'rating'
  AND k.keyword IN ('murder',
                    'murder-in-title',
                    'blood',
                    'violence')
  AND kt.kind = 'movie'
  AND mi.info IN ('Sweden',
                  'Norway',
                  'Germany',
                  'Denmark',

                  'German',
                  'USA',
                  'American')
  AND mi_idx.info < '8.5'
  AND t.production_year > 2010
  AND kt.id = t.kind_id
  AND t.id = mi.movie_id
  AND t.id = mk.movie_id
  AND t.id = mi_idx.movie_id
  AND mk.movie_id = mi.movie_id
  AND mk.movie_id = mi_idx.movie_id
  AND mi.movie_id = mi_idx.movie_id
  AND k.id = mk.keyword_id
  AND it1.id = mi.info_type_id
  AND it2.id = mi_idx.info_type_id;
```
