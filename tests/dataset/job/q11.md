# JOB Query 11 â€“ Non-Polish Sequel Links

[q11.mochi](./q11.mochi) joins several IMDB tables to find sequel movies between 1950 and 2000. The production company must not be from Poland and its name should contain "Film" or "Warner". The movie must have a link type mentioning "follow" and the company entry has a `NULL` note. The query returns the minimal company name, link type and movie title that satisfy all conditions.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT MIN(cn.name) AS from_company,
       MIN(lt.link) AS movie_link_type,
       MIN(t.title) AS non_polish_sequel_movie
FROM company_name AS cn,
     company_type AS ct,
     keyword AS k,
     link_type AS lt,
     movie_companies AS mc,
     movie_keyword AS mk,
     movie_link AS ml,
     title AS t
WHERE cn.country_code !='[pl]'
  AND (cn.name LIKE '%Film%'
       OR cn.name LIKE '%Warner%')
  AND ct.kind ='production companies'
  AND k.keyword ='sequel'
  AND lt.link LIKE '%follow%'
  AND mc.note IS NULL
  AND t.production_year BETWEEN 1950 AND 2000
  AND lt.id = ml.link_type_id
  AND ml.movie_id = t.id
  AND t.id = mk.movie_id
  AND mk.keyword_id = k.id
  AND t.id = mc.movie_id
  AND mc.company_type_id = ct.id
  AND mc.company_id = cn.id
  AND ml.movie_id = mk.movie_id
  AND ml.movie_id = mc.movie_id
  AND mk.movie_id = mc.movie_id;
```

## Expected Output
Only the first two movies match all predicates, so the lexicographically smallest values are returned:
```json
[
  {"from_company": "Best Film Co", "movie_link_type": "follow-up", "non_polish_sequel_movie": "Alpha"}
]
```
