# JOB Query 15 â€“ Internet Release After 2000

[q15.mochi](./q15.mochi) searches the IMDB tables for movies produced after 2000 that were released worldwide over the internet in the USA. The query returns the earliest release date and the associated movie title.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT MIN(mi.info) AS release_date,
       MIN(t.title) AS internet_movie
FROM aka_title AS at,
     company_name AS cn,
     company_type AS ct,
     info_type AS it1,
     keyword AS k,
     movie_companies AS mc,
     movie_info AS mi,
     movie_keyword AS mk,
     title AS t
WHERE cn.country_code = '[us]'
  AND it1.info = 'release dates'
  AND mc.note LIKE '%(200%)%'
  AND mc.note LIKE '%(worldwide)%'
  AND mi.note LIKE '%internet%'
  AND mi.info LIKE 'USA:% 200%'
  AND t.production_year > 2000
  AND t.id = at.movie_id
  AND t.id = mi.movie_id
  AND t.id = mk.movie_id
  AND t.id = mc.movie_id
  AND mk.movie_id = mi.movie_id
  AND mk.movie_id = mc.movie_id
  AND mk.movie_id = at.movie_id
  AND mi.movie_id = mc.movie_id
  AND mi.movie_id = at.movie_id
  AND mc.movie_id = at.movie_id
  AND k.id = mk.keyword_id
  AND it1.id = mi.info_type_id
  AND cn.id = mc.company_id
  AND ct.id = mc.company_type_id;
```

## Expected Output
For the minimal dataset only one movie satisfies all conditions, so the earliest release is returned.
```json
[
  { "release_date": "USA: March 2005", "internet_movie": "Example Movie" }
]
```
