# JOB Query 32 â€“ Linked Movies with Keyword

[q32.mochi](./q32.mochi) models a case where movies are connected by link types and tagged with keywords. It selects the lexicographically smallest link type and movie titles for films associated with the keyword `10,000-mile-club`.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT MIN(lt.link) AS link_type,
       MIN(t1.title) AS first_movie,
       MIN(t2.title) AS second_movie
FROM keyword AS k,
     link_type AS lt,
     movie_keyword AS mk,
     movie_link AS ml,
     title AS t1,
     title AS t2
WHERE k.keyword ='10,000-mile-club'
  AND mk.keyword_id = k.id
  AND t1.id = mk.movie_id
  AND ml.movie_id = t1.id
  AND ml.linked_movie_id = t2.id
  AND lt.id = ml.link_type_id
  AND mk.movie_id = t1.id;
```

## Expected Output
Only one pair of linked movies matches all predicates in the sample data:
```json
[{"link_type": "sequel", "first_movie": "Movie A", "second_movie": "Movie C"}]
```
