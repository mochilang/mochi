# TPC-DS Query 32 – Excess Catalog Discounts

This query calculates the total discount for catalog sales of a specific manufacturer that exceeds 130% of the average discount over a 90‑day window. The sample query fixes the manufacturer ID to 1 and the date window to the first quarter of 2000.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT SUM(cs_ext_discount_amt) AS "excess discount amount"
FROM catalog_sales
JOIN item ON i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
WHERE i_manufact_id = 1
  AND d_date BETWEEN DATE '2000-01-01' AND DATE '2000-04-01' + INTERVAL '90' DAY
  AND cs_ext_discount_amt > (
    SELECT 1.3 * AVG(cs_ext_discount_amt)
    FROM catalog_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
    WHERE cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
      AND d_date BETWEEN DATE '2000-01-01' AND DATE '2000-04-01' + INTERVAL '90' DAY
  );
```

## Expected Output
[q32.mochi](./q32.mochi) sums the discounts above the threshold for its small dataset:

20.0
