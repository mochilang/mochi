# TPC-DS Query 69

This query is reproduced from the official TPC-DS text. The example program in [q69.mochi](./q69.mochi) runs a small in-memory calculation.

## SQL
```sql
 define MONTH=random(1,4,uniform);
 define YEAR=random(1999,2004,uniform);
 define STATE= ulist(dist(fips_county, 3, 1), 3);
 define _LIMIT=100;
 
 [_LIMITA] select [_LIMITB] 
  cd_gender,
  cd_marital_status,
  cd_education_status,
  count(*) cnt1,
  cd_purchase_estimate,
  count(*) cnt2,
  cd_credit_rating,
  count(*) cnt3
 from
  customer c,customer_address ca,customer_demographics
 where
  c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk and
  ca_state in ('[STATE.1]','[STATE.2]','[STATE.3]') and
  cd_demo_sk = c.c_current_cdemo_sk and 
  exists (select *
          from store_sales,date_dim
          where c.c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk and
                ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
                d_year = [YEAR] and
                d_moy between [MONTH] and [MONTH]+2) and
   (not exists (select *
            from web_sales,date_dim
            where c.c_customer_sk = ws_bill_customer_sk and
                  ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and

## Expected Output
