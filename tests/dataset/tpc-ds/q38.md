# TPC-DS Query 38 – Cross-Channel Best Customers

Query 38 counts customers who made purchases in the store, catalog, and web channels within the same twelve‑month period.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM (
  SELECT DISTINCT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
  FROM store_sales
  JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  JOIN customer ON ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
  WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1200 AND 1211
  INTERSECT
  SELECT DISTINCT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
  FROM catalog_sales
  JOIN date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
  WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1200 AND 1211
  INTERSECT
  SELECT DISTINCT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
  FROM web_sales
  JOIN date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  JOIN customer ON ws_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
  WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1200 AND 1211
) hot_cust;
```

## Expected Output
[q38.mochi](./q38.mochi) reports the count for its small example dataset:
```json

```
