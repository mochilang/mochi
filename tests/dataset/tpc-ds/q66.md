# TPC-DS Query 66

This query is reproduced from the official TPC-DS text. The example program in [q66.mochi](./q66.mochi) runs a small in-memory calculation.

## SQL
```sql
  define YEAR= random(1998, 2002, uniform);
 define TIMEONE= random(1, 57597, uniform);
 define SMC = ulist(dist(ship_mode_carrier, 1, 1),2);
 define NETONE = text({"ws_net_paid",1},{"ws_net_paid_inc_tax",1},{"ws_net_paid_inc_ship",1},{"ws_net_paid_inc_ship_tax",1},{"ws_net_profit",1});
 define NETTWO = text({"cs_net_paid",1},{"cs_net_paid_inc_tax",1},{"cs_net_paid_inc_ship",1},{"cs_net_paid_inc_ship_tax",1},{"cs_net_profit",1});
 define SALESONE = text({"ws_sales_price",1},{"ws_ext_sales_price",1},{"ws_ext_list_price",1});
 define SALESTWO = text({"cs_sales_price",1},{"cs_ext_sales_price",1},{"cs_ext_list_price",1});
 define _LIMIT=100;
