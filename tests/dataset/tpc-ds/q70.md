# TPC-DS Query 70 â€“ Store Sales Rollup (Simplified)

This example summarizes store sales profit by state and county for a single year.
It is loosely based on the official TPC-DS query which ranks states by profit.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT
  SUM(ss_net_profit) AS total_sum,
  s_state,
  s_county
FROM store_sales
JOIN date_dim d1 ON d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
JOIN store ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk
WHERE d1.d_month_seq BETWEEN 1200 AND 1211
GROUP BY s_state, s_county
ORDER BY s_state, s_county;
```
```
## Expected Output
The simplified data produces two rows aggregated by state and county.
```json
[
  { "s_state": "CA", "s_county": "Orange", "total_sum": 15.0 },
  { "s_state": "TX", "s_county": "Travis", "total_sum": 20.0 }
]
```
