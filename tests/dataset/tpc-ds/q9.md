# TPC-DS Query 9

This query computes averages of different metrics for several quantity ranges. The example uses constants for the thresholds and returns no rows with an empty dataset.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20) > 10
            THEN (SELECT AVG(ss_ext_discount_amt) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20)
            ELSE (SELECT AVG(ss_net_paid) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20) END AS bucket1,
       CASE WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40) > 20
            THEN (SELECT AVG(ss_ext_discount_amt) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40)
            ELSE (SELECT AVG(ss_net_paid) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40) END AS bucket2,
       CASE WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60) > 30
            THEN (SELECT AVG(ss_ext_discount_amt) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60)
            ELSE (SELECT AVG(ss_net_paid) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60) END AS bucket3,
       CASE WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80) > 40
            THEN (SELECT AVG(ss_ext_discount_amt) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80)
            ELSE (SELECT AVG(ss_net_paid) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80) END AS bucket4,
       CASE WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100) > 50
            THEN (SELECT AVG(ss_ext_discount_amt) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100)
            ELSE (SELECT AVG(ss_net_paid) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100) END AS bucket5
FROM reason
WHERE r_reason_sk = 1;
```

## Expected Output
No rows match because the tables are empty.
```json
[]
```
