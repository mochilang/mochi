define YEAR = random(1998,2002,uniform);
select dt.d_year,
       item.i_brand_id as brand_id,
       item.i_brand as brand,
       sum(ss_ext_sales_price) as ext_price
from date_dim dt, store_sales, item
where dt.d_date_sk = store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk
  and store_sales.ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
  and item.i_manager_id = 1
  and dt.d_moy = [MONTH]
  and dt.d_year = [YEAR]
group by dt.d_year, item.i_brand, item.i_brand_id
order by dt.d_year, ext_price desc, brand_id;
```
