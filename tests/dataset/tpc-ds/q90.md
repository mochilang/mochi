## SQL
```sql
select cast(amc as decimal(15,4))/cast(pmc as decimal(15,4)) as am_pm_ratio
from
  (select count(*) amc
   from web_sales ws
   join household_demographics hd on ws.ws_ship_hdemo_sk = hd.hd_demo_sk
   join time_dim t on ws.ws_sold_time_sk = t.t_time_sk
   join web_page wp on ws.ws_web_page_sk = wp.wp_web_page_sk
   where t.t_hour between 7 and 8
     and hd.hd_dep_count = 2
     and wp.wp_char_count between 5000 and 5200) am,
  (select count(*) pmc
   from web_sales ws
   join household_demographics hd on ws.ws_ship_hdemo_sk = hd.hd_demo_sk
   join time_dim t on ws.ws_sold_time_sk = t.t_time_sk
   join web_page wp on ws.ws_web_page_sk = wp.wp_web_page_sk
   where t.t_hour between 14 and 15
     and hd.hd_dep_count = 2
     and wp.wp_char_count between 5000 and 5200) pm
order by am_pm_ratio;
```

## Expected Output
With the sample data the morning count is 2 and the evening count is 1 so the ratio is:
