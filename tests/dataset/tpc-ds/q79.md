# TPC-DS Query 79 (Excerpt)

This query lists customers with store purchases made on Mondays where coupon amounts contributed to profit. The filter considers household demographics such as dependent and vehicle counts.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT c_last_name, c_first_name, SUBSTR(s_city,1,30) AS s_city,
       ss_ticket_number, amt, profit
FROM (
  SELECT ss_ticket_number, ss_customer_sk, store.s_city,
         SUM(ss_coupon_amt) AS amt,
         SUM(ss_net_profit) AS profit
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
    JOIN household_demographics ON ss_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk
    WHERE (hd_dep_count = 2 OR hd_vehicle_count > 1)
      AND d_dow = 1
      AND d_year IN (1998,1999,2000)
      AND s_number_employees BETWEEN 200 AND 295
    GROUP BY ss_ticket_number, ss_customer_sk, ss_addr_sk, store.s_city
) ms
JOIN customer ON ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
ORDER BY c_last_name, c_first_name, SUBSTR(s_city,1,30), profit
LIMIT 100;
```

Only a single customer appears in this reduced example.

## Expected Output
```json
[
  { "c_last_name": "Smith", "c_first_name": "Alice", "s_city": "CityA", "ss_ticket_number": 1, "amt": 5.0, "profit": 10.0 }
]
```
