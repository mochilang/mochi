# TPC-DS Query 82

This query is reproduced from the official TPC-DS specification. The companion [q82.mochi](./q82.mochi) program only verifies that the environment runs and returns the query id.

## SQL
```sql
 define YEAR=random(1998,2002,uniform);
 define PRICE=random(0,90,uniform);
 define INVDATE=date([YEAR]+"-01-01",[YEAR]+"-07-24",sales);
 define MANUFACT_ID=ulist(random(1,1000,uniform),4);
 define _LIMIT=100;
 
 [_LIMITA] select [_LIMITB] i_item_id
       ,i_item_desc
       ,i_current_price
 from item, inventory, date_dim, store_sales
 where i_current_price between [PRICE] and [PRICE]+30
 and inv_item_sk = i_item_sk
 and d_date_sk=inv_date_sk
 and d_date between cast('[INVDATE]' as date) and (cast('[INVDATE]' as date) +  60 days)
 and i_manufact_id in ([MANUFACT_ID.1],[MANUFACT_ID.2],[MANUFACT_ID.3],[MANUFACT_ID.4])
 and inv_quantity_on_hand between 100 and 500
 and ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
 group by i_item_id,i_item_desc,i_current_price
 order by i_item_id
 [_LIMITC];
 

```

## Expected Output
```json
82
```
