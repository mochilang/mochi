# TPC-DS Query 71 â€“ Cross Channel Sales (Simplified)

This simplified example unions web, catalog and store sales for a single month
and groups totals by item brand and time of day.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT i_brand_id, i_brand, t_hour, t_minute,
       SUM(ext_price) AS ext_price
FROM (
  SELECT ws_ext_sales_price AS ext_price, ws_item_sk AS item_sk, ws_sold_time_sk AS time_sk
  FROM web_sales JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk
  WHERE d_moy = 12 AND d_year = 1998
  UNION ALL
  SELECT cs_ext_sales_price, cs_item_sk, cs_sold_time_sk
  FROM catalog_sales JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
  WHERE d_moy = 12 AND d_year = 1998
  UNION ALL
  SELECT ss_ext_sales_price, ss_item_sk, ss_sold_time_sk
  FROM store_sales JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
  WHERE d_moy = 12 AND d_year = 1998
) s
JOIN item ON item.i_item_sk = s.item_sk
JOIN time_dim ON time_dim.t_time_sk = s.time_sk
WHERE i_manager_id = 1
  AND (t_meal_time = 'breakfast' OR t_meal_time = 'dinner')
GROUP BY i_brand_id, i_brand, t_hour, t_minute
ORDER BY ext_price DESC, i_brand_id;
```

## Expected Output
With the small data set the result is:
```json
[
  { "i_brand_id": 10, "i_brand": "BrandA", "t_hour": 18, "t_minute": 0, "ext_price": 200.0 },
  { "i_brand_id": 20, "i_brand": "BrandB", "t_hour": 8, "t_minute": 30, "ext_price": 150.0 },
  { "i_brand_id": 10, "i_brand": "BrandA", "t_hour": 8, "t_minute": 30, "ext_price": 100.0 }
]
```
