# TPC-DS Query 31 – Channel Growth Comparison

This query compares quarter-over-quarter sales growth between the store and web channels for each county in a given year. The parameters here fix the year to 2000.

## SQL
```sql
WITH ss AS (
    SELECT ca_county, d_qoy, d_year, SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS store_sales
    FROM store_sales

    JOIN customer_address ON ss_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    GROUP BY ca_county, d_qoy, d_year
),
