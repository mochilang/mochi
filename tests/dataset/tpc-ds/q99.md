# TPC-DS Query 99

Query 99 classifies catalog shipments by the number of days between the sold and ship dates.

## SQL
```sql
select substr(w_warehouse_name,1,20), sm_type, cc_name,
       sum(case when cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 30 then 1 else 0 end) as "30 days",
       sum(case when cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 30 and cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 60 then 1 else 0 end) as "31-60 days",
       sum(case when cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 60 and cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 90 then 1 else 0 end) as "61-90 days",
       sum(case when cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 90 and cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 120 then 1 else 0 end) as "91-120 days",
       sum(case when cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 120 then 1 else 0 end) as ">120 days"
from catalog_sales
  join warehouse on cs_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk
  join ship_mode on cs_ship_mode_sk = sm_ship_mode_sk
  join call_center on cs_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk
group by substr(w_warehouse_name,1,20), sm_type, cc_name
order by substr(w_warehouse_name,1,20), sm_type, cc_name;
```

## Expected Output
The five sample sales fall into all buckets:
```json
[
  {"warehouse": "Warehouse1", "sm_type": "EXP", "cc_name": "CC1", "30 days": 1, "31-60 days": 1, "61-90 days": 1, "91-120 days": 1, ">120 days": 1}
]
```
