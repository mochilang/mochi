       SUM(ws_ext_ship_cost) AS "total shipping cost",
       SUM(ws_net_profit) AS "total net profit"
FROM web_sales ws1
JOIN date_dim ON ws1.ws_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk
JOIN customer_address ON ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
JOIN web_site ON ws1.ws_web_site_sk = web_site_sk
WHERE d_date BETWEEN DATE '1999-02-01' AND DATE '1999-04-02'
  AND ca_state = 'CA'
  AND web_company_name = 'pri'
  AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM web_sales ws2
              WHERE ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number
                AND ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk)
  AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM web_returns wr1
                  WHERE ws1.ws_order_number = wr1.wr_order_number)
ORDER BY COUNT(DISTINCT ws_order_number);
