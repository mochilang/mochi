# TPC-DS Query 16

This query comes from the TPC-DS specification. The example in
[q16.mochi](./q16.mochi) counts orders shipped from multiple warehouses within a
date range.

## SQL
```sql
define YEAR = random(1999, 2002, uniform);
define MONTH = random(2,5,uniform);
define STATE = dist(fips_county,3,1);   
define COUNTYNUMBER = ulist(random(1, rowcount("active_counties", "call_center"), uniform), 5);
define COUNTY_A = distmember(fips_county, [COUNTYNUMBER.1], 2);
define COUNTY_B = distmember(fips_county, [COUNTYNUMBER.2], 2);
define COUNTY_C = distmember(fips_county, [COUNTYNUMBER.3], 2);
define COUNTY_D = distmember(fips_county, [COUNTYNUMBER.4], 2);
define COUNTY_E = distmember(fips_county, [COUNTYNUMBER.5], 2);
define _LIMIT=100;

[_LIMITA] select [_LIMITB] 
   count(distinct cs_order_number) as "order count"
  ,sum(cs_ext_ship_cost) as "total shipping cost"
  ,sum(cs_net_profit) as "total net profit"
from
   catalog_sales cs1
  ,date_dim
  ,customer_address
  ,call_center
where
    d_date between '[YEAR]-[MONTH]-01' and 
           (cast('[YEAR]-[MONTH]-01' as date) + 60 days)
and cs1.cs_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk
and cs1.cs_ship_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
and ca_state = '[STATE]'
and cs1.cs_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk
and cc_county in ('[COUNTY_A]','[COUNTY_B]','[COUNTY_C]','[COUNTY_D]',
                  '[COUNTY_E]'
)
and exists (select *
            from catalog_sales cs2
            where cs1.cs_order_number = cs2.cs_order_number
              and cs1.cs_warehouse_sk <> cs2.cs_warehouse_sk)
and not exists(select *
               from catalog_returns cr1
               where cs1.cs_order_number = cr1.cr_order_number)
order by count(distinct cs_order_number)
[_LIMITC];


```

## Expected Output
One qualifying order results in the following totals.
```json
[{"order_count": 1, "total_shipping_cost": 5.0, "total_net_profit": 20.0}]
```
