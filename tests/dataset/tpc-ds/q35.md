  )
)
GROUP BY ca_state, cd_gender, cd_marital_status,
         cd_dep_count, cd_dep_employed_count, cd_dep_college_count
ORDER BY ca_state, cd_gender, cd_marital_status,
         cd_dep_count, cd_dep_employed_count, cd_dep_college_count;
```

## Expected Output
[q35.mochi](./q35.mochi) computes the grouped statistics for its sample customers:
```json
[
  {"ca_state": "CA", "cd_gender": "M", "cd_marital_status": "S", "cd_dep_count": 1, "cd_dep_employed_count": 1, "cd_dep_college_count": 0, "cnt": 1}
]
```
