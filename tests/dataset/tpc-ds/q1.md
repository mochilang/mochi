# TPC-DS Query 1

This query is reproduced from the official TPC-DS specification. The companion [q1.mochi](./q1.mochi) program only verifies that the environment runs and returns the query id.

## SQL
```sql
define COUNTY = random(1, rowcount("active_counties", "store"), uniform);
define STATE = distmember(fips_county, [COUNTY], 3); 
define YEAR = random(1998, 2002, uniform);
define AGG_FIELD = text({"SR_RETURN_AMT",1},{"SR_FEE",1},{"SR_REFUNDED_CASH",1},{"SR_RETURN_AMT_INC_TAX",1},{"SR_REVERSED_CHARGE",1},{"SR_STORE_CREDIT",1},{"SR_RETURN_TAX",1});
define _LIMIT=100;

with customer_total_return as
(select sr_customer_sk as ctr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk as ctr_store_sk
,sum([AGG_FIELD]) as ctr_total_return
from store_returns
,date_dim
where sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
and d_year =[YEAR]
group by sr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk)
[_LIMITA] select [_LIMITB] c_customer_id
from customer_total_return ctr1
,store
,customer
where ctr1.ctr_total_return > (select avg(ctr_total_return)*1.2
from customer_total_return ctr2
where ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk)
and s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk
and s_state = '[STATE]'
and ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
order by c_customer_id
[_LIMITC];
```

## Expected Output
```json
1
```
