This query aggregates catalog return losses by call center.

## SQL
```sql
select cc_call_center_id, cc_name, cc_manager,
       sum(cr_net_loss) as Returns_Loss
from call_center
  join catalog_returns on cr_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk
  join date_dim on cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
  join customer on cr_returning_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
  join customer_demographics on c_current_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
  join household_demographics on c_current_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk

where d_year = 2001
  and d_moy = 5
  and cd_marital_status = 'M'
  and cd_education_status = 'Unknown'
  and hd_buy_potential like '1001-5000%'
  and ca_gmt_offset = -6
group by cc_call_center_id, cc_name, cc_manager
order by Returns_Loss desc;
```
