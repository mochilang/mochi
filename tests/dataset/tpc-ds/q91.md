# TPC-DS Query 91 â€“ Returns Loss by Call Center (Simplified)

This simplified example sums catalog return losses for one call center and month.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT cc_call_center_id AS Call_Center,
       cc_name AS Call_Center_Name,
       cc_manager AS Manager,
       SUM(cr_net_loss) AS Returns_Loss
FROM call_center
JOIN catalog_returns ON cr_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk
JOIN date_dim ON cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
JOIN customer ON cr_returning_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
JOIN customer_address ON ca_address_sk = c_current_addr_sk
JOIN customer_demographics ON cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk
JOIN household_demographics ON hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk
WHERE d_year = 1998
  AND d_moy = 11
  AND cd_marital_status = 'M'
  AND cd_education_status = 'Unknown'
  AND hd_buy_potential LIKE '1001-5000%'
  AND ca_gmt_offset = -6
GROUP BY cc_call_center_id, cc_name, cc_manager
ORDER BY Returns_Loss DESC;
```

## Expected Output
```json
[
  { "Call_Center": 100, "Call_Center_Name": "Center", "Manager": "Manager", "Returns_Loss": 50.0 }
]
```
