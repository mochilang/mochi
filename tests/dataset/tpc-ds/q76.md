# TPC-DS Query 76 (Excerpt)

This query counts sales rows where certain foreign keys are `NULL` across all
three sales tables and reports the totals by quarter and item category.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT channel, col_name, d_year, d_qoy, i_category,
       COUNT(*) AS sales_cnt,
       SUM(ext_sales_price) AS sales_amt
FROM (
  SELECT 'store' AS channel, ss_customer_sk AS col_name,
         d_year, d_qoy, i_category, ss_ext_sales_price AS ext_sales_price
    FROM store_sales JOIN item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
                     JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE ss_customer_sk IS NULL
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'web', ws_bill_customer_sk,
         d_year, d_qoy, i_category, ws_ext_sales_price
    FROM web_sales JOIN item ON ws_item_sk = i_item_sk
                   JOIN date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE ws_bill_customer_sk IS NULL
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'catalog', cs_bill_customer_sk,
         d_year, d_qoy, i_category, cs_ext_sales_price
    FROM catalog_sales JOIN item ON cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
                       JOIN date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE cs_bill_customer_sk IS NULL
) foo
GROUP BY channel, col_name, d_year, d_qoy, i_category
ORDER BY channel, col_name, d_year, d_qoy, i_category
LIMIT 100;
```

The small example only demonstrates the query structure.
