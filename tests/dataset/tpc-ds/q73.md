# TPC-DS Query 73 (Excerpt)

This query identifies customers from selected counties who made one to five
purchases during the first two days of the month. Only households with buying
potential in specific ranges are considered.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT c_last_name, c_first_name, c_salutation, c_preferred_cust_flag,
       ss_ticket_number, cnt
FROM (
    SELECT ss_ticket_number, ss_customer_sk, COUNT(*) AS cnt
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
    JOIN household_demographics ON ss_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk
    WHERE d_dom BETWEEN 1 AND 2
      AND (hd_buy_potential = '1001-5000' OR hd_buy_potential = '0-500')
      AND hd_vehicle_count > 0
      AND hd_dep_count / hd_vehicle_count > 1
      AND d_year IN (1998,1999,2000)
      AND s_county IN ('A')
    GROUP BY ss_ticket_number, ss_customer_sk
) dj
JOIN customer ON ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
WHERE cnt BETWEEN 1 AND 5
ORDER BY cnt DESC, c_last_name ASC;
```

The simplified test data returns a single matching customer.
