# TPC-DS Query 72 (Excerpt)

The official specification counts how many catalog orders were shipped more than
five days after the sale when inventory was low. It groups the results by item
and warehouse.

## SQL
```sql
SELECT i_item_desc,
       w_warehouse_name,
       d1.d_week_seq,
       SUM(CASE WHEN p_promo_sk IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS no_promo,
       SUM(CASE WHEN p_promo_sk IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS promo,
       COUNT(*) AS total_cnt
FROM catalog_sales
JOIN inventory          ON cs_item_sk = inv_item_sk
JOIN warehouse          ON w_warehouse_sk = inv_warehouse_sk
JOIN item               ON i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
JOIN customer_demographics ON cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
JOIN household_demographics ON cs_bill_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk
JOIN date_dim d1        ON cs_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk
JOIN date_dim d2        ON inv_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk
JOIN date_dim d3        ON cs_ship_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk
LEFT JOIN promotion     ON cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk
LEFT JOIN catalog_returns ON cr_item_sk = cs_item_sk
  AND cr_order_number = cs_order_number
WHERE d1.d_week_seq = d2.d_week_seq
  AND inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity
  AND d3.d_date > d1.d_date + 5
  AND hd_buy_potential = '5001-10000'
  AND d1.d_year = 2000
  AND cd_marital_status = 'M'
GROUP BY i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d1.d_week_seq
ORDER BY total_cnt DESC, i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d_week_seq
LIMIT 100;
```

The Mochi implementation uses a much smaller data set and returns one row.
