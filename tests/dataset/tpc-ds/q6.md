# TPC-DS Query 6

This query is reproduced from the official TPC-DS specification. The companion [q6.mochi](./q6.mochi) program only verifies that the environment runs and returns the query id.

## SQL
```sql
 define YEAR = random(1998, 2002, uniform);
 define MONTH= random(1,7,uniform);
 define _LIMIT=100;
 
 [_LIMITA] select [_LIMITB] a.ca_state state, count(*) cnt
 from customer_address a
     ,customer c
     ,store_sales s
     ,date_dim d
     ,item i
 where       a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk
 	and c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk
 	and s.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
 	and s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
 	and d.d_month_seq = 
 	     (select distinct (d_month_seq)
 	      from date_dim
               where d_year = [YEAR]
 	        and d_moy = [MONTH] )
 	and i.i_current_price > 1.2 * 
             (select avg(j.i_current_price) 
 	     from item j 
 	     where j.i_category = i.i_category)
 group by a.ca_state
 having count(*) >= 10
 order by cnt, a.ca_state 
 [_LIMITC];

```

## Expected Output
```json
6
```
