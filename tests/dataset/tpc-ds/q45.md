```sql
select ca_zip, [GBOBC], sum(ws_sales_price)
 from web_sales, customer, customer_address, date_dim, item
 where ws_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
 	and c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk 
 	and ws_item_sk = i_item_sk 
 	and ( substr(ca_zip,1,5) in ('85669', '86197','88274','83405','86475', '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792')
 	      or 
 	      i_item_id in (select i_item_id
                             from item

                             )
 	    )
 	and ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk

 group by ca_zip, [GBOBC]
