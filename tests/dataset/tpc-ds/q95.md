# TPC-DS Query 95 â€“ Returned Web Orders (Simplified)

This example is similar to Query 94 but requires the order to be returned and shipped from multiple warehouses.

## SQL
```sql
WITH ws_wh AS (
  SELECT ws1.ws_order_number
  FROM web_sales ws1, web_sales ws2
  WHERE ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number
    AND ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk
)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ws_order_number) AS "order count",
       SUM(ws_ext_ship_cost) AS "total shipping cost",
       SUM(ws_net_profit) AS "total net profit"
FROM web_sales ws1
JOIN date_dim ON ws1.ws_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk
JOIN customer_address ON ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
JOIN web_site ON ws1.ws_web_site_sk = web_site_sk
WHERE d_date BETWEEN DATE '1999-02-01' AND DATE '1999-04-02'
  AND ca_state = 'CA'
  AND web_company_name = 'pri'
  AND ws1.ws_order_number IN (SELECT ws_order_number FROM ws_wh)
  AND ws1.ws_order_number IN (SELECT wr_order_number FROM web_returns, ws_wh
                              WHERE wr_order_number = ws_wh.ws_order_number)
ORDER BY COUNT(DISTINCT ws_order_number);
```

## Expected Output
```json
[
  { "order count": 1, "total shipping cost": 5.0, "total net profit": 10.0 }
]
```
