# TPC-DS Query 74 (Excerpt)

Query 74 compares year over year spending for customers across store and web
channels. Customers whose web growth outpaces store growth are returned.

## SQL
```sql

  SELECT c_customer_id AS customer_id,
         c_first_name AS customer_first_name,

  AND t_w_firstyear.year = 1998
  AND t_w_secyear.year = 1999
  AND t_s_firstyear.year_total > 0
  AND t_w_firstyear.year_total > 0
  AND t_w_secyear.year_total / t_w_firstyear.year_total >
      t_s_secyear.year_total / t_s_firstyear.year_total
ORDER BY customer_id
LIMIT 100;
```

The simplified data set yields one customer meeting the criteria.
