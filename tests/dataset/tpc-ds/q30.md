# TPC-DS Query 30 â€“ High-Return Customers

This query identifies customers from a given state whose total web returns in a particular year exceed 120% of the average return amount for that state. The example below fixes the year to 2000 and the state to `CA`.

## SQL
```sql
WITH customer_total_return AS (
  SELECT wr_returning_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
         ca_state AS ctr_state,
         SUM(wr_return_amt) AS ctr_total_return
  FROM web_returns
  JOIN date_dim ON wr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
  JOIN customer_address ON wr_returning_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
  WHERE d_year = 2000 AND ca_state = 'CA'
  GROUP BY wr_returning_customer_sk, ca_state
)
SELECT c_customer_id, c_first_name, c_last_name, ctr_total_return
FROM customer_total_return ctr
JOIN customer c ON ctr.ctr_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk
JOIN customer_address ca ON c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
WHERE ctr.ctr_total_return > (
  SELECT AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2
  FROM customer_total_return ctr2
  WHERE ctr.ctr_state = ctr2.ctr_state
)
ORDER BY c_customer_id;
```

## Expected Output
For the simplified dataset in [q30.mochi](./q30.mochi) the query returns one qualifying customer:
```json
[
  {"c_customer_id": "C1", "c_first_name": "John", "c_last_name": "Doe", "ctr_total_return": 150.0}
]
```
