SELECT i_item_id,
       s_state,
       AVG(ss_quantity)    AS agg1,
       AVG(ss_list_price)  AS agg2,
       AVG(ss_coupon_amt)  AS agg3,
       AVG(ss_sales_price) AS agg4
FROM store_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, store, item
WHERE ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  AND ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
  AND ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
  AND ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
  AND cd_gender = 'F'
  AND cd_marital_status = 'M'
  AND cd_education_status = 'College'
  AND d_year = 2000
  AND s_state IN ('CA')
GROUP BY ROLLUP(i_item_id, s_state)
ORDER BY i_item_id, s_state;
