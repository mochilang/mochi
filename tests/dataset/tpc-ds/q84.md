# TPC-DS Query 84

This query is reproduced from the official TPC-DS specification. The simplified
version in [q84.mochi](./q84.mochi) joins customer demographics with returns to
list customers from a single city within a specific income range.

## SQL
```sql
 define CITY = dist(cities, 1, large);
 define INCOME = random(0, 70000, uniform);
 define _LIMIT=100;
 
 [_LIMITA] select [_LIMITB] c_customer_id as customer_id
       , coalesce(c_last_name,'') || ', ' || coalesce(c_first_name,'') as customername
 from customer
     ,customer_address
     ,customer_demographics
     ,household_demographics
     ,income_band
     ,store_returns
 where ca_city	        =  '[CITY]'
   and c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
   and ib_lower_bound   >=  [INCOME]
   and ib_upper_bound   <=  [INCOME] + 50000
   and ib_income_band_sk = hd_income_band_sk
   and cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk
   and hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk
   and sr_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
 order by c_customer_id
 [_LIMITC];
 

```

## Expected Output
```json
84
```
