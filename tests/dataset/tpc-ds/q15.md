# TPC-DS Query 15

This query comes from the TPC-DS specification. The example in
[q15.mochi](./q15.mochi) totals catalog sales by ZIP code for a minimal dataset.

## SQL
```sql
 define YEAR=random(1998,2002,uniform);
 define QOY=random(1,2,uniform);
 define _LIMIT=100;
 
 [_LIMITA] select [_LIMITB] ca_zip
       ,sum(cs_sales_price)
 from catalog_sales
     ,customer
     ,customer_address
     ,date_dim
 where cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
 	and c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk 
 	and ( substr(ca_zip,1,5) in ('85669', '86197','88274','83405','86475',
                                   '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792')
 	      or ca_state in ('CA','WA','GA')
 	      or cs_sales_price > 500)
 	and cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
 	and d_qoy = [QOY] and d_year = [YEAR]
 group by ca_zip
 order by ca_zip
 [_LIMITC];

```

## Expected Output
The single matching ZIP has total sales of 600.
```json
[{"ca_zip": "85669", "sum_sales": 600.0}]
```
