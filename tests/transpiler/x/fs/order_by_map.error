/workspace/mochi/tests/transpiler/x/fs/order_by_map.fs(16,47): error FS0001: The type 'Anon3' does not support the 'comparison' constraint because it is a record, union or struct with one or more structural element types which do not support the 'comparison' constraint. Either avoid the use of comparison with this type, or add the 'StructuralComparison' attribute to the type to determine which field type does not support comparison
