  |                        ^ `(&str, i64)` cannot be formatted with the default formatter

  = help: the trait `std::fmt::Display` is not implemented for `(&str, i64)`
  = note: in format strings you may be able to use `{:?}` (or {:#?} for pretty-print) instead
  = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::format_args_nl` which comes from the expansion of the macro `println` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
