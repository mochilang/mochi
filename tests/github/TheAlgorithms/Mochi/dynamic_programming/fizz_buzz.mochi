/*
Fizz Buzz is a simple programming exercise used to teach control flow.
Starting from a given number, each subsequent number is examined up to a
specified limit. For multiples of three the algorithm outputs "Fizz",
for multiples of five it outputs "Buzz", and for numbers divisible by
both three and five it outputs "FizzBuzz". All other numbers are
represented as themselves. The concatenated results form the final
string. The algorithm runs in O(n) time where n is the range length.
