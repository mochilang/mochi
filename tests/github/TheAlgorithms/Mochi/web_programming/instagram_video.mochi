/*
Problem: Download an Instagram video via the Downloadgram service.

The reference Python implementation performs two HTTP requests:
1. Combine the service endpoint with the Instagram post URL to create a request URL.
2. Fetch that URL to obtain the direct video link, then download the video bytes
   and save them to disk with a timestamped file name.

This Mochi version focuses on the core URL construction step and prints the
resulting download link. Network access and file operations are omitted so the
program can run inside the VM without external dependencies.
