/*
  Solve Project Euler problem 1: find the sum of all natural numbers below a
  given limit that are multiples of 3 or 5.  Starting from zero, we iterate
  through each integer less than n and accumulate those divisible by 3 or 5.
  This straightforward approach runs in O(n) time and uses constant extra
  space.  It is written entirely in Mochi so it executes on the runtime/vm
  without any foreign function interfaces.
