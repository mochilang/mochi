/*
Project Euler Problem 6: Sum square difference

Given a positive integer n, compute the difference between the square of the
sum of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the squares of the first n
natural numbers.

Algorithm:
1. Iterate from 1 to n, accumulating the running sum and the sum of squares.
2. After the loop, square the running sum to obtain the square of the sum.
3. Subtract the sum of squares from the square of the sum to obtain the
   desired difference.

The script prints the result for n = 100, which is the classic Project Euler
instance.
