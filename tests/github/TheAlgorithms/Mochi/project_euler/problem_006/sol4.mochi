Project Euler Problem 6: Sum square difference

Given a positive integer n, we want the difference between:
1. The square of the sum of the first n natural numbers.
2. The sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers.

Using closed-form formulas:
- Sum of squares = n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 6
- Square of sum = (n * (n + 1) / 2)^2
The desired result is square_of_sum - sum_of_squares.

This implementation is written in pure Mochi, uses only integer arithmetic,
and avoids the `any` type.

  return square_of_sum - sum_of_squares
