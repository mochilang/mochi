/*
Project Euler Problem 6: Sum square difference

Compute the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares
for the first n natural numbers.  Using the formulas
  sum_{i=1}^n i = n(n + 1) / 2
  sum_{i=1}^n i^2 = n(n + 1)(2n + 1) / 6
we avoid iteration and compute the result in constant time.

  let sum_cubes: int = sum * sum
  let sum_squares: int = n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 6
  return sum_cubes - sum_squares
