/*
Project Euler Problem 9: Find the unique Pythagorean triplet (a, b, c)
for which a + b + c = 1000 and a^2 + b^2 = c^2, then compute the
product a * b * c. The algorithm iterates over all pairs (a, b),
computes c = 1000 - a - b, and checks the Pythagorean condition.
When the condition is satisfied, the product is returned. This brute
force search runs in O(n^2) time for n = 1000 with constant space.
