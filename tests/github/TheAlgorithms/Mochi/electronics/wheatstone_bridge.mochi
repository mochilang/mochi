/*
Wheatstone Bridge Solver
------------------------
Computes the unknown resistance in a Wheatstone bridge circuit when
three resistances (R1, R2, and R3) are known. The bridge balances when
R1/R2 = R3/Rx. Rearranging gives Rx = (R2 / R1) * R3. All resistances
must be positive; otherwise the function panics. Time complexity is O(1).
