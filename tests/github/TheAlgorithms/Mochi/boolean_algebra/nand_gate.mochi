/*
Simulate a NAND logic gate.

A NAND gate outputs 0 only when both inputs are non-zero (True);
otherwise it outputs 1. This is equivalent to applying a NOT
operation to the result of an AND gate. Each input is treated
according to standard truthiness where any non-zero integer counts
as True.

The algorithm runs in constant time and space.
