/*
Implement the NIMPLY logic gate, also known as NOT-IMPLIES.

The gate returns 1 only when the first input is 1 and the second input is 0.
For all other combinations the result is 0.  This is equivalent to
A AND NOT B or the negation of (A -> B).  The function expects integer
inputs of 0 or 1 and produces an integer 0 or 1.  The computation is
performed in constant time.
