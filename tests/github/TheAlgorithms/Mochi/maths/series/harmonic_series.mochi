/*
Harmonic Series Generator
-------------------------
Constructs the harmonic series up to a given term n. The harmonic
series is defined as 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n. This implementation
returns each term as a string in a list.

Given a floating point input n, the value is truncated to an integer
number of terms similar to Python's int() conversion. Non-positive
values yield an empty list.

Algorithm:
1. If n_term <= 0, return an empty list.
2. For i from 1 to floor(n_term), append "1/i" to the list (with the
   first element being just "1").

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
