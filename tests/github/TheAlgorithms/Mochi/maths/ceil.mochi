/*
Compute the ceiling of a real number.

For any real number x, the ceiling function returns the smallest integer
greater than or equal to x. To avoid relying on any floating-point library
routines, this implementation casts the value to an integer which truncates
toward zero. If x already equals this truncated integer, the truncated value
is the ceiling. Otherwise one is added to handle positive fractions, yielding
an integer that is still >= x even for negative inputs.
