/*
Multiplication Table Generator
------------------------------
Given an integer and the number of terms, this program constructs the
multiplication table as a single newline separated string. The algorithm is:
1. Start a counter at 1 and an empty result string.
2. Repeatedly multiply the base number by the counter.
3. Append a formatted line "number * counter = product" to the result.
4. Insert a newline after each line except the last one.
5. Continue until the counter exceeds the desired number of terms.

This mirrors the Python implementation from TheAlgorithms and runs using the
pure Mochi runtime/vm without any foreign interfaces.
