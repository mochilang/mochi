/*
Hexagonal Numbers
-----------------
A hexagonal number counts dots that can form a regular hexagon. The nth
hexagonal number H_n represents the number of distinct dots in a pattern of
n concentric hexagons sharing a common vertex.  It is given by the closed
form formula:

  H_n = n * (2n - 1)

This implementation mirrors TheAlgorithms Python version. It validates that
the input is a positive integer and computes H_n directly from the formula.
The sequence begins 1, 6, 15, 28, ...
