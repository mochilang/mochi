/*
Perfect Number Checker

A perfect number is a positive integer equal to the sum of its proper divisors
(excluding itself).  For example, 6 has divisors 1, 2, 3 and 6.  Ignoring the
number itself, 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 so it is perfect.  This program implements the
classic test for perfect numbers:

Algorithm:
1. If n \le 0 then it is not perfect.
2. Iterate i from 1 to n/2 (inclusive) and accumulate divisors of n.
3. Compare the divisor sum with n; equality means n is perfect.

The loop runs in O(n) time because it scans all potential divisors up to n/2.
