/*
Compute the nth s-gonal (polygonal) number.

Polygonal numbers generalize triangular, square, pentagonal, and other figurate numbers.
The nth s-gonal number counts dots arranged in a regular polygon with `s` sides.
It can be calculated directly using the formula:

  P(n, s) = ((s - 2) * n^2 - (s - 4) * n) / 2

The function validates that n >= 0 and s >= 3, since polygonal numbers are defined
only for non-negative indices and polygons with at least three sides.

Time complexity: O(1) using the closed-form formula.
Space complexity: O(1).
