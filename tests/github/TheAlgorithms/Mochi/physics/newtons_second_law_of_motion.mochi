/*
Newton's Second Law of Motion

Computes the net force acting on a body using F = m * a.
Mass is measured in kilograms and acceleration in meters per
second squared. The result is the force in Newtons. Inputs
are validated to be non-negative; if invalid values are provided
the function returns 0.0.
