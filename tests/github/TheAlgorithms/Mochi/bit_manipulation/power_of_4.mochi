/*
Determine whether a positive integer is a power of four.

A number is a power of four if it is positive and can be repeatedly divided
by 4 until the value becomes 1. This procedure is equivalent to checking
that only one bit is set in the binary representation and that the set bit
is located at an even position. We avoid direct bitwise operations by using
integer division and remainder. The loop runs O(log_4 n) iterations.
