/*
  Check if an integer is even using bit manipulation. In binary, even numbers
  have 0 as their least significant bit while odd numbers have 1. By applying a
  bitwise AND with 1 we isolate this bit; a result of 0 indicates the number is
  even and 1 means it is odd. This constant-time approach avoids division or
  modulo operations. In Mochi we emulate this by taking the number modulo 2,
  which yields the same least-significant bit.
