/*
Price Plus Tax
--------------
Given the base price of a good or service and a tax rate expressed as a
fraction, this algorithm computes the total cost including tax.  The
final price is obtained by multiplying the price by (1 + tax_rate).
For example, a price of 100 with a 25% tax rate yields 125.
