/*
Calculate employee pay including overtime at time and a half.

Given the total hours worked, the hourly pay rate, and the number of
standard hours before overtime applies, the algorithm computes the
regular pay for all hours worked and then adds an extra half-rate
for each hour above the threshold. This effectively pays 1.5 times
for every overtime hour.
