# Machine Generated PHP Programs

This directory contains PHP code compiled from Mochi programs by the
PHP backend tests.

Each file in `tests/vm/valid` is compiled and executed. Successful
runs produce a `.out` file with the program output. Failures result in
an `.error` file capturing the line number and context of the error.

## Checklist

Compilation results will appear here after running the tests.
