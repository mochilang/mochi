# Python Machine Output

This directory holds Python source code generated from `tests/vm/valid` programs.
Each `.mochi` file is compiled and run. Passing examples have a `.out` file while
failures may produce a `.error` file.

Compiled programs: 90/100

The compiler does not yet perfectly match the reference output for every test,
so some programs remain unchecked.
