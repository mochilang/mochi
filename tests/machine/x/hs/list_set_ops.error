    Not in scope: ‘List.\’
    NB: the module ‘Data.List’ does not export ‘\’.
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps use one of these:
        ‘List.\\’ (imported from Data.List),
        ‘List.!!’ (imported from Data.List),
        ‘List.++’ (imported from Data.List)

    |                     ^^^^^^


Context around line 109:
  107| main = do
  108|   print (List.union [1, 2] [2, 3])
  109|   print (([1, 2, 3] List.\ [2]))
  110|   print (List.intersect [1, 2, 3] [2, 4])
  111|   print (length ([1, 2] ++ [2, 3]))
