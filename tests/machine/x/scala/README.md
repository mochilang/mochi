# Scala Machine Generated Programs

This directory contains Scala source code produced automatically from the Mochi programs in `tests/vm/valid`.  The compiler lives in `compiler/x/scala` and the generated code is built with `scalac` and executed with `scala`.

## Compilation status

- 97 / 97 programs compiled

Most programs run successfully.  Files that failed to compile or run have a matching `.error` file capturing the failure.

## Remaining work

- Finish full query join support
- Improve `load`/`save` expression handling
