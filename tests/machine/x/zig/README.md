# Zig Machine Output

This directory contains Zig source code generated by the Mochi compiler. Each program from `tests/vm/valid` is compiled to Zig and executed. If the program runs successfully, a `.out` file with its output is stored next to the `.zig` source. Compilation or runtime failures will produce a `.error` file instead.

Compiled programs: 23/97
