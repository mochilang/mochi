# Mochi to C# Compiler Outputs (0/97 compiled)

This directory holds C# source files generated from the Mochi programs in `tests/vm/valid` using the experimental C# compiler. Each program that compiles successfully has a `.cs` file and a corresponding `.out` file with its runtime output. If compilation or execution fails, a `.error` file will describe the problem.

## Checklist

<!-- The list will be populated once the tests are executed and files are generated. -->
