# Mochi to Rust Machine Outputs

Generated Rust code for the programs under `tests/vm/valid`. Each file here has
a `.rs` source produced by the compiler and an `.out` file with its runtime
output. All 100 programs compile successfully.

Recently regenerated examples include:
- `map_assign`
- `map_index`
- `map_literal_dynamic`
- `map_nested_assign`
- `group_by_conditional_sum`
