Given      a          text       file   of     many      lines,     where    fields  within  a      line 
are        delineated by         a      single 'dollar'  character, write    a       program 
that       aligns     each       column of     fields    by         ensuring that    words   in     each 
column     are        separated  by     at     least     one        space.   
Further,   allow      for        each   word   in        a          column   to      be      either left 
justified, right      justified, or     center justified within     its      column.
