Cows and bulls/player
You think of four digit number of unique digits in the range 1 to 9.
I guess.  You score my guess:
    A correct digit but not in the correct place is a cow.
    A correct digit in the correct place is a bull.
You give my score as two numbers separated with a space.
My guess: 1234.  Score? (c b)
I did it. :)
