/workspace/mochi/tests/rosetta/transpiler/FS/15-puzzle-solver.fs(3,1): warning FS0221: The declarations in this file will be placed in an implicit module '15-puzzle-solver' based on the file name '15-puzzle-solver.fs'. However this is not a valid F# identifier, so the contents will not be accessible from other files. Consider renaming the file or adding a 'module' or 'namespace' declaration at the top of the file.
