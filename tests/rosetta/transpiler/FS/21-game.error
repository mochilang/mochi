/workspace/mochi/tests/rosetta/transpiler/FS/21-game.fs(40,55): error FS0597: Successive arguments should be separated by spaces or tupled, and arguments involving function or method applications should be parenthesized

/workspace/mochi/tests/rosetta/transpiler/FS/21-game.fs(3,1): warning FS0221: The declarations in this file will be placed in an implicit module '21-game' based on the file name '21-game.fs'. However this is not a valid F# identifier, so the contents will not be accessible from other files. Consider renaming the file or adding a 'module' or 'namespace' declaration at the top of the file.
