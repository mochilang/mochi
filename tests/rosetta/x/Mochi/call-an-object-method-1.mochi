// Mochi translation of Rosetta "Call an object method" example 1
// Demonstrates calling methods on an instance.

type Foo {
  fun ValueMethod(x: int) {}
  fun PointerMethod(x: int) {}
}

var myValue = Foo{}
var myPointer = Foo{}

// Calling value method on value
myValue.ValueMethod(0)
// Calling pointer method on pointer (simulated)
myPointer.PointerMethod(0)

// Value methods can also be called on our pointer variable
myPointer.ValueMethod(0)
// Pointer methods can be called on the value variable
myValue.PointerMethod(0)

// Accessing methods as regular functions would normally require
// additional language features. Here we simply call the methods
// directly on the objects again.
myValue.ValueMethod(0)
myPointer.PointerMethod(0)
