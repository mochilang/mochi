Binary search tree nodes:
Node(key=10, freq=34)
Node(key=12, freq=8)
Node(key=20, freq=50)
Node(key=25, freq=40)
Node(key=37, freq=30)
Node(key=42, freq=3)

The cost of optimal BST for given tree nodes is 324.
20 is the root of the binary search tree.
10 is the left child of key 20.
12 is the right child of key 10.
25 is the right child of key 20.
37 is the right child of key 25.
42 is the right child of key 37.
