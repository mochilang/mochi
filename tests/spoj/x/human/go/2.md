# [SPOJ PRIME1 - Prime Generator](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PRIME1/)

## Algorithm

We need to print all primes in several ranges `[m, n]` where `1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 10^9` and `n - m ≤ 100000`.  Checking each number
individually is too slow, so we use a **segmented sieve**:

1. Generate all primes up to `√n` with the classic Sieve of Eratosthenes.
2. Create a boolean array representing the numbers in `[m, n]` and mark all as potential primes.
3. For each base prime `p`, mark multiples of `p` within `[m, n]` as composite.
4. Remaining true entries correspond to primes and are output in order.

The algorithm runs in `O((n-m+1) log log √n)` time per test case and uses `O(n-m)` additional space.

## Correctness

- The initial sieve correctly finds all primes up to `√n`, which suffice to test divisibility for any number in `[m, n]`.
- Every multiple of a base prime within `[m, n]` is marked composite; primes remain unmarked.
- Numbers less than 2 are excluded, ensuring only primes are printed.

## Complexity Analysis

Let `k = n - m + 1` (≤ 100000).
- Building the base sieve costs `O(√n log log √n)` time and `O(√n)` space.
- Marking composites in the segment costs `O(k log log √n)` time and `O(k)` space.
Thus, each test case runs efficiently within the constraints.
