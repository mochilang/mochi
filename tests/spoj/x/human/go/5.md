# SPOJ Problem 5 - The Next Palindrome

[Link to problem](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PALIN/)

## Algorithm

Given a numeric string `K` representing an integer up to one million digits, the goal is to find the smallest palindrome strictly larger than `K`.

1. Convert the input string into a list of digits for easy manipulation.
2. Check if all digits are 9. If so, the next palindrome is `1` followed by `(len(K)-1)` zeros and a trailing `1`.
3. Otherwise mirror the left half of the number to the right to form a palindrome.
4. Compare the mirrored value with the original. If the mirrored value is not greater, increment the middle digit(s) with carry propagation to the left and mirror again.
5. Finally convert the digit list back to a string.

This approach operates in linear time and constant extra space aside from the digit list.

## Complexity

Let `n` be the number of digits in `K`.
- Time: `O(n)`
- Space: `O(n)`
