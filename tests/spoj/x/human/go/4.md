# PICAD - Crime at Piccadilly Circus

[Problem link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PICAD/)

## Algorithm

We are given the time interval `[p, k]` when the crime could have been committed and `n` people with their presence intervals `[a_i, b_i]`. We need the minimum and maximum number of people simultaneously present at the crime scene during `[p, k]`.

1. For each person, intersect `[a_i, b_i]` with `[p, k]`. Ignore people whose intervals do not overlap with `[p, k]`.
2. For every remaining interval `[s, e]`, create two sweep-line events: `+1` at time `s` and `-1` at time `e + 1` (intervals are inclusive).
3. Add boundary events at `p` and `k + 1`.
4. Sort all event times. Sweep through them in order, maintaining the current count of people. For each segment between consecutive event times that overlaps `[p, k]`, update the minimum and maximum counts.

This sweep-line algorithm runs in `O(n log n)` time due to sorting and uses `O(n)` extra memory.
