# Substring Check (Bug Funny)

[Problem on SPOJ](https://www.spoj.com/problems/SBSTR1/)

## Algorithm

For each line of input, read two binary strings A and B. Use `strings.Contains` to check if B is a substring of A. Output `1` if the substring exists and `0` otherwise. Input may contain multiple pairs, so process lines until EOF.

## Complexity

Let n be the length of A and m the length of B. The substring check runs in \(O(n \times m)\) time using Go's built-in search, which is effectively constant for the fixed string lengths in this problem.
