Read integers from standard input, one per line, and echo them to output
until the value `42` is encountered. The sentinel `42` itself and any
following numbers are ignored.

## Algorithm
1. Repeatedly read a line.
2. Convert the line to an integer.
3. If the integer is `42`, stop processing.
4. Otherwise, print the integer and continue.

This is a straightforward linear scan with `O(n)` time and `O(1)`
additional memory.
