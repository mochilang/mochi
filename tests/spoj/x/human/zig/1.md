## Problem Summary
Read integers from standard input and print each on its own line until the sentinel value `42` is encountered. The value `42` and any numbers after it should not be output.

## Algorithm
1. Read input byte by byte and construct integers from consecutive digit characters.
2. Whenever a non-digit is encountered after reading digits, convert the accumulated value to a number.
3. If the number equals `42`, terminate the program.
4. Otherwise, print the number followed by a newline and reset the accumulator.
5. After reaching end-of-file, print any pending number if it is not `42`.

The algorithm runs in linear time relative to the number of input characters and uses constant additional memory.
