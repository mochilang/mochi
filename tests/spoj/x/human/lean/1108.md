# SPOJ CTRICK - Card Trick

We are given a deck of `n` cards labelled `1..n`. We repeatedly perform:

1. Move the top card to the bottom `k` times (starting with `k = 1`).
2. Deal the new top card to the table.
3. Increase `k` and repeat until all cards are dealt.

The task is to determine the initial order of the deck so that the dealt
sequence is `1,2,...,n`.

## Algorithm

We maintain a queue of positions `1..n`. For each value `k = 1..n`:

1. Rotate the queue `k` times by removing the front element and pushing it to the back.
2. Pop the front position and place card `k` at that position in the answer array.

This simulates the process in reverse: the queue keeps track of the
positions in the deck, and by rotating it we mimic moving cards from the
front to the back. Assigning `k` to the popped position reconstructs the
initial arrangement.

The overall complexity is `O(n^2)` which is sufficient for `n â‰¤ 20000`.
