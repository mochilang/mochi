# [Alpha Centauri Tennis](https://www.spoj.com/problems/ACT/)

## Problem Summary
Given `N` players and a transcript of ball winners for an Alpha Centauri Tennis match, determine which player wins the match. Games are played with tennis-like scoring using these rules applied after each ball:
- If the winning player has 3 points and no other player has more than 2, they win the game.
- Else if the player has 4 points, they win the game.
- Else if another player has 4 points, that opponent loses one point and the winner gains one.
- Otherwise, the winner gains one point.
A set is won by the first player with at least 6 games and at least two more games than any other player. If all other players have 0 games in that set, the set counts as two sets. The first player to win three sets wins the match.

## Algorithm
1. Maintain arrays for points in the current game, games in the current set, and sets won, all of size `N`.
2. For each ball winner `p` in the transcript:
   - Apply the scoring rules above to update points and possibly award a game.
   - When a game is won by `p`, reset point totals and update their game count. If `p` now has at least 6 games and two more than any opponent, award the set. If opponents have no games, award two sets instead of one, then reset game counts.
3. After processing all balls, the player with at least three sets is the match winner.

The simulation requires `O(|S| * N)` time with constant additional memory, suitable for the given limits (`N ≤ 10`, `|S| ≤ 50000`).
