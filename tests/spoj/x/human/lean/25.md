# SPOJ POUR1 - Pouring water

[Problem link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/POUR1/)

## Algorithm

1. For each test case with capacities `a` and `b` and target `c`:
   - If `c > max(a, b)` or `c` is not divisible by `gcd(a, b)`, the goal is impossible; output `-1`.
   - Otherwise simulate the pouring process in two directions:
     * start with jug `a` full and pour into `b`;
     * start with jug `b` full and pour into `a`.
   - Each simulation counts operations: fill, empty, or pour. During simulation we repeatedly
     transfer water from the "from" jug to the "to" jug until either jug contains `c` litres.
   - The answer is the minimum number of steps from the two simulations.

This works because any measurable volume must be a multiple of the GCD, and starting from either
jug yields all optimal sequences.

## Complexity

For each test case the simulation performs at most `a + b` transfers, giving `O(a + b)` time and `O(1)` space.
