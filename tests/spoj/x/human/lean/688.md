# [Toy Cars](https://www.spoj.com/problems/SAM)

## Problem Summary
Given `n` toy cars and space for at most `k` cars on the floor, a child requests a sequence of `p` cars to play with. When a requested car is not on the floor, the mother brings it from the shelf and may return one floor car to the shelf. Knowing the entire sequence in advance, minimize the number of times she must fetch a car from the shelf.

## Algorithm
1. Precompute for each car the future positions at which it will be requested.
2. Maintain the set of cars currently on the floor and, for each, the index of its next request.
3. For each request in order:
   - Remove the current index from the car's list to determine its next occurrence.
   - If the car is already on the floor, update its next-use index.
   - Otherwise increment the fetch counter. If the floor is full, evict the car whose next use is farthest in the future (or never) before placing the new car on the floor.
4. The final counter is the minimal number of fetches required.
