# EASYPIE - Easy Problem

We analyse the contest submission log to compute statistics for problems Aâ€“I.
For every team we store a record for each problem containing:

- number of submissions,
- whether it was solved,
- and the time of the accepted submission.

Submissions are processed in chronological order.  If a team has already solved
a problem, later submissions for that problem are ignored.  Otherwise the count
of submissions is incremented and, on an accepted run, the solved flag and time
are recorded.

After reading all submissions, the information is aggregated per problem.  For
each of the nine problems we compute:

1. the number of teams that solved it,
2. the total number of submissions by those teams,
3. the total solution time.

If no team solved a problem, only the problem letter and zero are printed.
Otherwise the averages `total_submissions / solved` and `total_time / solved`
are output, rounded to two decimal places.
