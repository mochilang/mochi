# VOCV - Con-Junctions

The city network forms a tree. Placing a light at a junction lights all incident streets. We must find the minimum number of lights needed so every street is lit and count how many such optimal placements exist (mod 10007).

## Algorithm
- Build adjacency list for the tree.
- Root the tree at node `1` and obtain a post-order traversal with an explicit stack.
- For each node `v` maintain two states:
  - `dp1[v]` – `v` has a light. Size is `1 +` sum of minima of child states, counting combinations when multiple minima exist.
  - `dp0[v]` – `v` has no light. All children must have lights: size is sum of `dp1` sizes; counts multiply.
- Counts are multiplied modulo `10007`. When both child states have equal size, add counts.
- Process nodes in reverse of the traversal to ensure children are computed before parents.
- The result for the root is the smaller of `dp0` and `dp1`; if equal, add counts.

## Complexity
`O(n)` per test case in both time and memory.
