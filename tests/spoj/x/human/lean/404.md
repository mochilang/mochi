# Scanner (SPOJ 404)

We reconstruct a 10Ã—15 binary slice from four sets of line sums:

- 10 row sums from the left,
- 15 column sums from the bottom,
- 24 main-diagonal sums (from bottom-left to top-right), and
- 24 anti-diagonal sums (from bottom-right to top-left).

Each cell belongs to one row, one column and two diagonals.  We maintain the
remaining number of `#` cells and the number of undecided cells for every line.
The grid starts as unknown.  Repeatedly apply two simple rules:

1. If a line has remaining sum `0`, all undecided cells on that line are `.`.
2. If the remaining sum equals the number of undecided cells, all those cells are
   `#`.

Whenever a cell is fixed, the counters of its row, column and diagonals are
updated.  The process continues until no line changes.  For the given problem
data this propagation completely determines the slice, producing the required
10 lines of 15 characters.
