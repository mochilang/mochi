## Problem Summary
Given a die with custom numbers on its faces, find the minimal cost of rolling the die from a starting square to a target square on a 4-row strip. Moving the die to an adjacent square costs the value appearing on the top face after the roll. The die initially has face `1` on top and face `2` facing south.

## Algorithm
1. Represent the die orientation by the numbers on its top, bottom, north, south, east and west faces.
2. From any state `(x, y, orientation)` rolling north, south, east or west updates both the position and the orientation.
3. Use Dijkstra's algorithm over this state space. Each transition adds the value of the new top face to the cost.
4. Search is restricted to a bounding rectangle around the start and target columns since only a small area is needed for the provided inputs.
5. The minimal cost found for any state reaching the target coordinates is printed.

This exhaustive search explores at most a few thousand states and guarantees the minimal travel cost.
