## Problem Summary
Given a rectangular platform with length `D` and depth `S`, `N` cuboid blocks fall vertically without rotation. Each block is described by its base dimensions `d × s`, height `w`, and the coordinates `(x, y)` of its lower-left corner on the platform. A block falls until it touches the platform or the existing stack and then remains there. The goal is to determine the height of the highest point after all blocks have landed.

## Algorithm
1. Keep a two-dimensional array `grid[S][D]` recording the current height at every cell of the platform.
2. For each block:
   - Inspect the rectangle `[x, x + d)` × `[y, y + s)` to find `base`, the maximum height already present inside it.
   - The block comes to rest on this base, so its top reaches `base + w`.
   - Update every cell inside the rectangle to this new height.
   - Track the highest value seen over all updates.
3. After all blocks are processed, output the recorded maximum height.

The platform dimensions are at most 1000 × 1000, so this direct simulation is sufficient.
