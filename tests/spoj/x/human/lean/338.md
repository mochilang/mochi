## Problem Summary
Given multiple test cases, each with directed roads between cities. Every road has a length and a toll cost. Bob starts at city 1 and wants to reach city N without spending more than K coins in tolls. Find the minimum total length of such a path or output -1 if it doesn't exist.

## Algorithm
1. Build an adjacency list of outgoing roads for each city.
2. Dynamic programming over toll budgets:
   - `dist[c][k]` stores the shortest distance to reach city `c` with exactly `k` coins spent.
   - Initialize all values to infinity except `dist[1][0] = 0`.
   - For each possible toll `k` from `0` to `K` and each city `c`, relax all outgoing edges `(c -> d)` with length `L` and toll `T`:
     - New toll `nk = k + T`. If `nk <= K` and `dist[d][nk] > dist[c][k] + L`, update `dist[d][nk]`.
3. After processing all toll budgets, the answer is the minimum over `dist[N][k]` for `k <= K`. If no finite value exists, return `-1`.

This approach runs in `O(K * (N + R))` time and uses `O(N*K)` memory, which fits the problem constraints.
