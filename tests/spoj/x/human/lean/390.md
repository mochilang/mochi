## Problem Summary
A ball starts from the center of an `a` by `b` billiard table. After `s` seconds it returns to the start, having bounced `m` times off the vertical sides and `n` times off the horizontal sides. Determine the launch angle (0-90 degrees from the horizontal) and the initial speed.

## Algorithm
Consider unfolding the table at each bounce so the ball travels in a straight line through mirrored tables. After `m` vertical bounces the horizontal travel is `a * m`, and after `n` horizontal bounces the vertical travel is `b * n`.

The launch angle `A` and speed `v` are:

* `A = atan2(b*n, a*m) * 180 / Ï€`
* `v = sqrt((a*m)^2 + (b*n)^2) / s`

Format both values to two decimal places for each input line until the terminating `0 0 0 0 0` line.
