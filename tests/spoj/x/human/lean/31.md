## Problem Summary
For each test case, multiply two non-negative integers.  Up to 1000 pairs are
given and every number can have up to 10â€¯000 decimal digits.

## Algorithm
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each of the next `t` lines, split the line into two strings representing
   the multiplicands.
3. Convert both strings to arbitrary-precision natural numbers and multiply
   them.
4. Output the product as a decimal string.

Lean's `Nat` type supports arbitrary-precision arithmetic, so this direct
approach is sufficient for the required input sizes.
