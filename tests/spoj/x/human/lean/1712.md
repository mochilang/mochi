# PRMLX - Permalex

Given a string of up to 30 lowercase letters, find its 1‑based position in the
lexicographic ordering of all distinct permutations of its letters.  For
example, "acab" appears as the fifth string in its ordered list of 12
permutations.

## Algorithm

1. Count how many times each letter `a…z` occurs.
2. Scan the string from left to right.  At position `i` with character `c`:
   - For every alphabet letter `d < c` that is still available, temporarily
     decrease its count and compute how many permutations can be formed from the
     remaining multiset of characters.  Add this number to the rank.
   - Finally, decrease the count of `c` and continue with the next position.
3. The number of permutations of a multiset is
   `total! / (cnt₁! × cnt₂! × …)` which we compute with factorials.
4. After the loop, add one to obtain the 1‑based rank.

## Correctness

- Every string lexicographically smaller than the input differs at the first
  position where a smaller character is placed.  Step 2 enumerates all such
  possibilities and counts the permutations that follow each one, so it counts
  exactly the number of strings preceding the input.
- The permutation formula in step 3 gives the exact number of arrangements of
  the remaining multiset, ensuring each possible continuation is counted once.
- Adding one at the end yields the position of the original string in the
  ordered list of all distinct permutations.

## Complexity

Let `n ≤ 30` be the length of the string.  For each of the `n` positions we scan
up to 26 letters and compute a factorial‐based permutation count, which is `O(1)`
for bounded `n`.  Therefore the total time is `O(26n)` and the memory usage is
`O(1)`.
