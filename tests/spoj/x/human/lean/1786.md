## Problem Summary
A circle of `n` people removes every second person until one remains. The input
gives `n` in the form `"xy" "e" "z"` meaning the decimal number with digits `x`
and `y` followed by `z` zeros. The sequence ends with `00e0`.

## Algorithm
1. Parse each line into `n = (10*x + y) * 10^z`.
2. For step size 2 of the Josephus problem, the survivor is `2*(n - 2^⌊log2 n⌋) + 1`.
3. Find the largest power of two not exceeding `n` by repeatedly doubling.
4. Output the survivor for each test case until the terminator is read.

This runs in `O(log n)` per test case for numbers up to 99,000,000.
