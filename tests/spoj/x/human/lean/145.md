## Problem Summary
Given up to 100000 points on a plane, find the smallest circle that
contains all points.  Output its radius and center coordinates, rounded
to two decimals.

## Algorithm
We use the randomized incremental algorithm (Welzl's algorithm) for the
smallest enclosing circle:

1. Read all points and shuffle them uniformly at random.  The random
   order avoids the quadratic worst case and gives expected linear time.
2. Iterate through the points, maintaining the minimal circle for the
   processed prefix.  If the current point lies inside the circle, do
   nothing.
3. Otherwise the point must lie on the boundary.  Set the circle to
   have radius `0` centered at this point and reconsider all previous
   points.  If a previous point lies outside, the new circle is the
   one defined by that pair.  If another earlier point still lies
   outside, compute the circumcircle of the three boundary points.

Computing the circle from two or three points is straightforward using
geometry formulas; containment checks use squared distances to avoid
unnecessary square roots.  The resulting circle is output with values
rounded to two decimal places.
