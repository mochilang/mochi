# SERVERS - Interesting server data

We run Dijkstra from each server to compute the shortest distance to every other
server.  The servers are then grouped by distance from the source.  A server is
interesting for the source if its rank is maximal among all servers whose
distance is not greater than its own.  When scanning groups in order of increasing
distance, we keep the highest rank seen so far; within each group only nodes with
the maximal rank of that group can be interesting and they update the best rank.
Summing the number of interesting servers over all sources gives the total data
requirement.
