## Problem Summary
We are given a directed graph of bus stops with positive travel costs. All volunteers start at the Central Checkpoint Stop (node `1`).
Each volunteer must travel to a distinct assigned stop and return to the CCS at the end of the day. We must compute the minimal total
cost of transporting all volunteers.

## Algorithm
1. Read `P` (number of stops) and `Q` edges.
2. Build adjacency lists for the graph and its reverse.
3. Run Dijkstra's algorithm from node `1` on the original graph to get the minimum cost from the CCS to every stop.
4. Run Dijkstra again on the reversed graph to obtain the minimum cost from each stop back to the CCS.
5. Sum the forward and reverse distances for every stop and print the total.

Dijkstra's algorithm with non-negative edge weights guarantees the optimal transportation cost.
