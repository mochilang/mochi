# [Adding Reversed Numbers](https://www.spoj.com/problems/ADDREV)

## Problem Summary
Given two integers whose digits are written in reverse order, reverse each number, add them, and output the reverse of the sum for every test case. Leading zeros are ignored after each reversal.

## Algorithm
1. For each test case read two numbers `a` and `b`.
2. Define a helper `revNat` that repeatedly takes the last digit of a number and builds the reversed value.
3. Compute `revNat a` and `revNat b`, add them, then apply `revNat` to the sum.
4. Print the final reversed value.

The `revNat` function runs in time proportional to the number of digits, so the overall complexity is linear in the total input size.
