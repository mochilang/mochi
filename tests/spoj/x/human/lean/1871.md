# [Making A Budget](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MKBUDGET)

## Problem Summary
Given up to 24 months of required temporary workers and the costs of hiring, salary, and firing for each worker, compute the minimum total cost to satisfy the monthly requirements. Initially there are no workers and terminating workers after the final month is free.

## Algorithm
1. Read N, hiring cost `H`, monthly salary `S`, severance cost `F`, and the required workers for each of the `N` months. Repeat for multiple cases until `N = 0`.
2. Let `maxReq` be the maximum required workers among all months.
3. Use dynamic programming where `dp[i][w]` is the minimum cost after `i` months when `w` workers are employed.
4. Initialize `dp[0][0] = 0` and the rest to infinity.
5. For each month `i` and each possible worker count `w` (0..`maxReq`) with `w â‰¥ requirement[i]`:
   - Consider every previous worker count `p`.
   - Compute adjustment cost for hiring or firing and add salary `w * S`.
   - Update `dp[i][w]` with the minimum total cost.
6. The answer is the minimum value among `dp[N][w]` for all `w`.

The algorithm runs in `O(N * maxReq^2)` time and uses `O(maxReq)` memory.
