# [Tower of Babylon](https://www.spoj.com/problems/BABTWR)

## Problem Summary
Given several types of rectangular blocks (with unlimited copies) and allowing any rotation, build the tallest possible tower. A block may be placed on top of another only if both its width and depth are strictly smaller. Multiple test cases are given, terminated by `n = 0`.

## Algorithm
1. For each block, generate its three orientations by choosing each dimension as the height and sorting the remaining two so that width ≥ depth.
2. Sort all orientations in descending order of base area (width × depth).
3. Dynamic programming: for each orientation `i`, compute the tallest stack ending with `i` on top. For every earlier orientation `j` with both base sides larger, update `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + h_i)`.
4. The maximum of all `dp[i]` values is the answer for that test case.

With at most 30 block types this results in no more than 90 orientations, making the `O(n^2)` DP easily fast enough.
