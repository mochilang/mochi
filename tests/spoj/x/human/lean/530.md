# DIV2 - Divisors 2

We need all integers `N` in `[1, 10^6]` such that:

* `d(N) > 3`, where `d(x)` is the number of positive divisors of `x`.
* For every divisor `M` of `N`, the value `d(M)` divides `d(N)`.

Only every 108-th qualifying `N` is printed.

## Algorithm

1. **Divisor counts:** Precompute `d(i)` for all `i â‰¤ 10^6` using a sieve. For each `i` increment `d(j)` for every multiple `j` of `i`.
2. **Check candidates:** For each `n` from `1` to `10^6` with `d(n) > 3`, test all divisors `k` up to `sqrt(n)`.
   For each divisor `k` and its pair `n/k` verify that `d(k)` and `d(n/k)` divide `d(n)`.
3. **Collect every 108-th:** Maintain a counter of valid numbers and output `n` whenever the counter modulo `108` equals `107`.

This runs in O(n log n) to precompute divisor counts and O(sqrt(n)) per candidate check, which is fast enough for `10^6`.
