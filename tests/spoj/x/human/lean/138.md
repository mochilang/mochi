# [Election Posters](https://www.spoj.com/problems/POSTERS/)

## Problem Summary
Given `n` posters placed on a wall, each covering a contiguous range of integer
sections `[l, r]`, later posters may cover parts of earlier ones.  Determine how
many posters remain at least partially visible after all have been placed.

## Algorithm
1. **Coordinate compression** – store every `l` and `r+1`, sort them and remove
duplicates.  Each interval becomes a half-open range of indices over the
compressed coordinates.
2. **Disjoint-set union** – maintain an array `parent` where `find(i)` returns the
first unpainted segment at or to the right of `i`.  Painting a segment links it
to the next one (`parent[i] = i+1`).
3. **Process posters in reverse** – for each poster `[l, r)` from last to first,
   repeatedly `find` the next unpainted segment within the range, mark it as
   painted, and continue.  If any segment was painted, the poster is visible.
4. Count how many posters painted at least one segment and output the total.

Each segment is painted at most once; with at most `2n` unique coordinates the
runtime is `O(n log n)` due to sorting, and nearly linear afterwards.
