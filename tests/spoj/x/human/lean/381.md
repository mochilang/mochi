## Problem Summary
Given up to 100 intersections connected by streets, each with a probability that the Blues Brothers can pass safely, find the path from intersection 1 to intersection n that maximizes the overall probability of success. Input consists of multiple test cases ending with a single 0.

## Algorithm
1. Build an adjacency list storing for each street `a b p` two directed edges `(a,b,p/100)` and `(b,a,p/100)`.
2. Run a probability-maximizing Dijkstra variant:
   - Maintain `best[v]`, the highest probability to reach each node.
   - Use a priority queue ordered by probability (implemented as a sorted list).
   - Start with node 1 at probability 1.0. Pop the node with highest probability, skip if stale, and relax all outgoing edges: if `prob * weight > best[to]`, update and push.
   - Stop when the queue is empty or node `n` is popped.
3. The answer is `best[n] * 100`, printed with six digits after the decimal followed by `" percent"`.

The complexity is `O(m log n)` with the priority queue (here a list suffices because `n â‰¤ 100`).
