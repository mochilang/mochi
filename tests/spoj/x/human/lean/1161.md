# [Tic-Tac-Toe ( I )](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TOE1)

## Problem Summary
Given multiple 3×3 Tic Tac Toe board states containing `X`, `O`, and `.` characters, determine for each board whether it could occur during a valid game (X moves first, players alternate, and play stops when someone wins).

## Algorithm
1. Count the number of `X` and `O` symbols.
2. Check all rows, columns and diagonals for a winning line for each player.
3. Apply validity rules:
   - `X` count must be either equal to `O` count or exactly one larger.
   - If `X` has a winning line, it must have one more move than `O`.
   - If `O` has a winning line, counts must be equal.
   - Both players cannot win simultaneously.
4. If none of the rules are violated, the board state is valid; otherwise it is invalid.

This algorithm scans the 3×3 grid a few times and uses only constant extra memory.
