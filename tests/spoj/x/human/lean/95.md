## Problem Summary
Given the order in which trucks numbered from 1 to n arrive, determine whether they can be rearranged into increasing order using a single side street that acts as a stack. Trucks can move to the side street and leave in last-in-first-out order. The process ends when input `0` is encountered.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize `expected` to 1 and an empty stack.
2. For each truck in the arrival sequence:
   - Pop from the stack while its top equals `expected`, incrementing `expected` each time.
   - If the current truck equals `expected`, increment `expected` directly.
   - Otherwise push the truck onto the stack.
3. After processing all trucks, pop remaining items from the stack if they match `expected`.
4. If all trucks were output in order (i.e., `expected = n + 1`), output `yes`; else output `no`.

This algorithm runs in O(n) time with O(n) auxiliary space for the stack.
