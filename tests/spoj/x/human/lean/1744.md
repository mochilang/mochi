# [Evaluate the polynomial](https://www.spoj.com/problems/POLEVAL)

## Problem Summary
Given a polynomial of degree \(n\) with coefficients \(c_n, \ldots, c_0\), evaluate it at \(k\) integer points. Multiple test cases are provided, terminated by a line containing `-1`.

## Algorithm
For each test case:
1. Read the degree and the \(n+1\) coefficients in descending order.
2. Read \(k\) and the list of evaluation points \(x_1, \ldots, x_k\).
3. For each \(x_i\), compute the value of the polynomial using Horner's method:
   \[ (((c_n x_i + c_{n-1}) x_i + \ldots + c_1) x_i + c_0) \]
4. Output the case label followed by each evaluated value on its own line.

Horner's method evaluates each point in \(O(n)\) time with constant extra space, which is efficient for the given limits.
