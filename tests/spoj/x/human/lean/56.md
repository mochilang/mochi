# DYZIO - Dyzio

The problem encodes a sequence of rope cuts. Each `1` denotes a cut that splits a piece into two halves. After a cut, the description of the left piece comes first, followed by the right piece. A `0` marks a piece that is not cut further.

This encoding is exactly a preorder traversal of a full binary tree where internal nodes are `1` and leaves are `0`. Every cut halves the rope, so the shortest piece corresponds to a leaf at the maximum depth of this tree. Because cuts on the left side are always performed before moving to the right, the first time such a leaf appears is the moment the shortest piece is produced.

To find the number of cuts made before the first deepest leaf is created:

1. Traverse the sequence in preorder while simulating the order of cuts.  
2. Maintain a stack to emulate recursion and store the depth and cut index for right subtrees yet to be processed.  
3. Keep a counter of performed cuts and the current depth.  
4. When encountering `0`, update the maximum depth and record the cut number that produced this piece (the parent cut). Then continue with the next pending right subtree from the stack.  
5. When encountering `1`, increment the cut counter, push the information about the right child on the stack, and move to the left child.

The recorded cut number corresponding to the first leaf at the maximum depth is the answer. The algorithm runs in `O(n)` time and uses `O(h)` auxiliary memory, where `h` is the height of the tree.
