## Problem Summary
Given up to 10,000 line segments, merge all segments that lie on the same infinite line and overlap or touch. For each test case, output the minimal number of segments needed to represent their union. Input ends with `0`.

## Algorithm
1. Multiply all coordinates by 100 to work with integers.
2. For each segment:
   - Compute a normalized direction vector `(dx, dy)` by dividing by the GCD and fixing orientation.
   - Derive a line key `k = dx * y - dy * x` using one endpoint; this uniquely identifies the line.
   - Project both endpoints onto the direction using `t = dx * x + dy * y` and record interval `[min t1 t2, max t1 t2]` for that line.
3. For each line, sort its intervals and merge whenever the next interval starts no later than the current end.
4. Count merged intervals across all lines and print the sum.

The dominant cost is sorting intervals on each line, giving O(n log n) time per test case.
