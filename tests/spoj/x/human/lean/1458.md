## Problem Summary
Given integers n and M, and pairs (k_i, p_i) for i=1..n (1≤n≤6, 1≤M≤150), count how many n-tuples (x_1,…,x_n) with 1≤x_i≤M satisfy
k₁x₁^{p₁} + k₂x₂^{p₂} + … + kₙxₙ^{pₙ} = 0.
Coefficients k_i may be negative. The answer fits in 32-bit signed integer.

## Algorithm
1. For each variable precompute all values k_i * x^{p_i} for x from 1 to M.
2. Split the variables into two halves. Generate every possible sum of the first half and sort the list.
3. Generate sums for the second half. For each sum s, binary search the sorted list for occurrences of −s. The number of matches contributes to the total count.
4. Output the accumulated total.

Meet-in-the-middle reduces the search from M^n to about M^{n/2} on each side (≤3.4 million when n=6 and M=150), which is feasible under the limits.
