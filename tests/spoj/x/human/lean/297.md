# AGGRCOW - Aggressive cows

[Problem Link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/AGGRCOW/)

## Algorithm

1. Read stall positions and sort them in ascending order.
2. Binary search the largest distance `d` such that at least `C` cows can be placed with spacing â‰¥ `d`.
   - For a candidate `d`, greedily place the first cow in the first stall and each next cow in the earliest stall at least `d` away from the previous one.
   - If `C` cows can be placed, the distance is feasible; search higher, otherwise search lower.
3. Output the maximal feasible distance.

## Complexity

Let `n` be the number of stalls. Sorting takes `O(n log n)` time. The feasibility check is `O(n)` and is executed `O(log M)` times where `M` is the stall coordinate range, giving overall `O(n log n + n log M)` time and `O(1)` additional memory.
