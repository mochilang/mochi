# [The Unstable Cube](https://www.spoj.com/problems/UCUBE/)

## Problem Summary
Given the six orthogonal views (front, left, back, right, top and bottom) of an N×N×N cube after some unit blocks have disappeared, each cell shows the colour of the first visible block on that ray or a dot if the ray is empty. Determine the maximum number of blocks that may remain while remaining consistent with all six projections.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize an N×N×N array with unknown blocks (`?`).
2. For every view and for each ray (row and column):
   - If the projection cell is `.` mark every cube cell along that ray as empty.
   - Otherwise scan along the ray from the viewing side:
     - Skip already empty cells.
     - If the first non-empty cell is unknown or has the required colour, assign that colour and stop.
     - If it has a different colour, mark it empty and continue deeper on the ray.
3. After all views are processed, count cells not marked empty; this is the maximal number of remaining blocks.

This algorithm runs in O(N³) per test case.
