# [Edge](https://www.spoj.com/problems/EDGE)

## Problem Summary
Given a string of `A` and `V` describing clockwise and counter-clockwise turns of a folded paper's edge, output PostScript commands tracing the edge. The drawing starts at `(300, 420)` with 10-unit segments and 90° turns.

## Algorithm
1. Output the initial commands `300 420 moveto` and `310 420 lineto` to start at the base position.
2. Maintain the current direction, initially pointing east from `(310, 420)`.
3. For each character in the input string:
   - Rotate the direction 90° clockwise for `A` or 90° counter-clockwise for `V`.
   - Advance 10 units in the updated direction and emit `x y lineto` for the new point.
4. After processing all characters, print `stroke` and `showpage` to finalize the PostScript drawing.

Each character is processed once, and the computation uses only a few integers to track position and direction.
