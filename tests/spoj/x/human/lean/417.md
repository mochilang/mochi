# LAZYPROG - The lazy programmer

## Algorithm
1. Read all contracts `(a_i, b_i, d_i)`.
2. Sort contracts by increasing deadline `d_i`.
3. Iterate through the sorted contracts, keeping the total scheduled time and a data
   structure of already seen contracts ordered by `a_i` (the rate at which paying
   reduces time).
4. After adding each contract, if total time exceeds its deadline, repeatedly
   shorten previously added contracts. Always shorten the contract with the
   largest `a_i` first, because each unit of time removed from such a contract
   costs `1 / a_i`, which is minimal. Reduce as much as needed from that contract
   and update the total cost. Continue until the deadline constraint is satisfied.
5. After processing all contracts, output the accumulated minimum extra payment
   with two digits after the decimal point.

## Correctness
- Contracts are executed in order of increasing deadlines; any optimal schedule
  can be rearranged this way without increasing the required payments.
- When total time exceeds a deadline, removing time from the contract with the
  largest `a_i` gives the cheapest possible reduction per unit time. Therefore
  repeatedly choosing this contract yields the minimal cost to satisfy the
  deadline.
- Since every deadline is enforced after inserting its contract, all deadlines
  are met in the final schedule, and the accumulated payments are minimal.

## Complexity
Let `n` be the number of contracts.
- Sorting the contracts costs `O(n log n)` time.
- Each contract is inserted into and possibly removed from the priority
  structure once, and each reduction step takes `O(log n)` time. The overall
  complexity is `O(n log n)` with `O(n)` additional space.
