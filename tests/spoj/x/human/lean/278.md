# Bicycle

Peter can ride only along two circular bicycle lanes and switch lanes only at their intersections. Given centers and radii of the two circles and the start and end points on the lanes, we need the minimal distance along the lanes or `-1` if unreachable.

## Algorithm

1. **Parse input** for both circles and the start/end points.
2. **Find intersection points** of the two circles using the standard geometry formulas. If the circles do not intersect we simply connect points that lie on the same circle.
3. **Create graph nodes** for the start point, end point and each intersection. Each node keeps flags indicating whether it lies on circle 1, circle 2 or both.
4. **Add edges**: for any pair of nodes that lie on the same circle, compute the shorter arc length between them (`radius * angle`). If the pair lies on both circles, use the shorter arc over either circle.
5. **Run Floyd–Warshall** on the tiny graph (at most four nodes) to obtain the minimal distance between all pairs of nodes.
6. The answer is the distance from the start node to the end node. If no path exists the distance remains infinite and we output `-1`.

## Correctness

- Every legal path on the lanes moves along arcs of one of the two circles and switches only at intersection points. Our graph contains exactly these points as nodes and includes an edge for every possible arc between nodes, weighted by its length. Therefore any valid route corresponds to a walk in this graph of equal length, and vice versa.
- The Floyd–Warshall algorithm computes the shortest path between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph with non‑negative weights, so the distance returned for the start/end pair is the minimal possible distance along the lanes.
- When no path exists, the start and end nodes belong to different connected components of the graph, hence their distance remains infinite and we output `-1`.

## Complexity

With at most four nodes, Floyd–Warshall runs in constant time. In general the algorithm is `O(V^3)` with `V ≤ 4`, so it is easily fast enough for the input limits.
