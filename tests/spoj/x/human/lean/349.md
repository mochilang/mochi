# Solution for 349 - Around the world

Farms lie on a circle represented by longitudes `0..359`.  Each flight travels
along the **shortest arc** between two longitudes, so it is either clockwise or
counterclockwise.  While travelling, Farmer John wants the total clockwise
distance to differ from the total counterclockwise distance when he returns to
his starting farm.  This means the signed sum of arcs around his trip must be a
non‑zero multiple of 360 degrees.

For every edge `(u,v)` we compute a signed weight `w` representing
`clockwise - counterclockwise` distance when moving from `u` to `v`:

* `cw = (lon[v] - lon[u] + 360) mod 360`
* if `cw ≤ 180` the arc is clockwise and `w = cw`
* otherwise the arc is counterclockwise and `w = cw - 360` (a negative value)
* the reverse direction uses weight `-w`

We perform a breadth‑first search over states `(node, diff)` where `diff` is the
total signed distance travelled so far.  The range of `diff` is bounded to
`[-720, 720]` which is sufficient to detect the first full rotation.
Starting from `(1,0)`, for each state we push neighboring states with updated
`diff`.  Whenever we pop `(1, d)` with `d ≠ 0` and `d mod 360 = 0`, we have
found the minimum number of flights required.

If the queue empties without finding such a state the trip is impossible and we
output `-1`.
