# INCR - Increasing Subsequences

[SPOJ Problem](https://www.spoj.com/problems/INCR/)

For `1 ≤ N ≤ 40` and `1 ≤ B ≤ 5`, count permutations of `1..N` whose
longest increasing subsequence has length exactly `B`.  By the
Robinson–Schensted correspondence, the length of the longest increasing
subsequence equals the length of the first row of the Young diagram of
a permutation.  Therefore the answer is

```
∑_(λ ⊢ N, λ₁ = B) (f^λ)²
```

where the sum runs over partitions `λ` of `N` with largest part `B`, and
`f^λ` is the number of standard Young tableaux of shape `λ`.  The value
`f^λ` is computed by the hook‑length formula

```
f^λ = N! / ∏_cells hook(cell)
```

The algorithm enumerates all partitions of `N` with first part `B`,
computes the hook length product for each partition, derives `f^λ`, and
accumulates `(f^λ)²` modulo `1_000_000_000`.
