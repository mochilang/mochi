# SEQPAR2 - Sequence Partition

We are given `N` pairs `(A_i, B_i)` and an upper bound `Limit`.  The pairs
must be split into contiguous segments.  For every element in an earlier
segment and any element in a later segment the `B` value of the former must be
greater than the `A` value of the latter.  If `M_i` is the maximum `A` inside
segment `i`, the sum of all `M_i` must not exceed `Limit`.  For each segment
`S_i` is the sum of its `B` values and we want to minimise the maximum `S_i`.

For a candidate answer `T` we check feasibility greedily.  Pre-compute
`sufMaxA[i]` – the maximum `A` from position `i` to the end.  Starting from the
first index we extend the current segment while the accumulated `B` sum does not
exceed `T`.  During the extension we maintain the segment’s maximum `A` and
minimum `B`.  Whenever `minB > sufMaxA[r+1]` the segment ending at `r` satisfies
the ordering restriction, so we remember the best such `r`.  After the scan the
segment is fixed at the latest valid `r`; its `maxA` contributes to the running
total and we continue from `r+1`.  If at any point the total exceeds `Limit` or
no valid `r` is found, `T` is infeasible.  Otherwise all elements can be
partitioned using maximum `B` sum `T`.

Binary search over `T` between the largest individual `B` and the total `B`
sum yields the minimal possible maximum segment sum.
