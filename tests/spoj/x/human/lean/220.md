## Problem Summary
Given up to ten encrypted messages consisting of lowercase letters, find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice without overlapping in each message.

## Algorithm
1. Binary search on the substring length `L` from 0 to the length of the shortest message.
2. For a candidate `L`, for each message:
   - Use a rolling hash to scan all substrings of length `L`.
   - Track the first occurrence of each hash. When the same hash reappears at position `i` such that the previous occurrence ends at or before `i`, record the hash as valid for this message.
3. Count hashes that are valid in every message. If any hash appears in all messages, length `L` is feasible.
4. The largest feasible `L` found via binary search is the answer.

The rolling hash makes each check run in linear time, leading to an overall complexity of `O(n * m * log m)` for `n` messages of length up to `m`.
