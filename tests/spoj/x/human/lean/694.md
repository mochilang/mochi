# [DISUBSTR - Distinct Substrings](https://www.spoj.com/problems/DISUBSTR/)

## Problem Summary
For each test case, given a string (length \(\leq 1000\)) we must compute the number of distinct substrings it contains.

## Algorithm
1. **Suffix generation and sorting**
   - Generate all suffixes of the string: `s[i:]` for `0 â‰¤ i < n`.
   - Sort these suffixes lexicographically. This is `O(n^2 log n)` because each suffix copy costs up to `O(n)`.
2. **Longest Common Prefix (LCP)**
   - The total number of substrings of a string of length `n` is `n(n+1)/2`.
   - When suffixes are sorted, the overlap between consecutive suffixes is counted via their LCP lengths.
   - Subtracting the sum of LCPs from the total substrings yields the number of distinct substrings.

This approach is sufficient for the constraints (\(n \le 1000\)) and is straightforward to implement.
