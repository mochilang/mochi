# [Geometry and a Square](https://www.spoj.com/problems/GEOM)

## Problem Summary
Given the center of a square, its side length and a point \(P\) in the plane, construct four lines:
- through vertex \(A\) perpendicular to line \(BP\),
- through vertex \(B\) perpendicular to line \(CP\),
- through vertex \(C\) perpendicular to line \(DP\),
- through vertex \(D\) perpendicular to line \(AP\).
Determine whether these four lines intersect in a single point and, if so, output its coordinates rounded to one decimal place.

## Algorithm
1. From the square's center \((c_x,c_y)\) and side length \(s\) compute the vertices in clockwise order:
   - \(A=(c_x-\tfrac{s}{2}, c_y+\tfrac{s}{2})\)
   - \(B=(c_x+\tfrac{s}{2}, c_y+\tfrac{s}{2})\)
   - \(C=(c_x+\tfrac{s}{2}, c_y-\tfrac{s}{2})\)
   - \(D=(c_x-\tfrac{s}{2}, c_y-\tfrac{s}{2})\)
2. For each vertex create a line in general form \(ax+by+c=0\) using the vector from the next vertex to \(P\) as the normal:
   - line through \(A\) with normal \(BP = P-B\),
   - through \(B\) with normal \(CP\),
   - through \(C\) with normal \(DP\),
   - through \(D\) with normal \(AP\).
3. Examine all pairs of lines. For any pair with a non-zero determinant compute their intersection.
4. Verify that the intersection lies on all four lines (\(|ax+by+c| < 10^{-6}\)). If such a point exists output `YES` and its coordinates (rounded to one decimal). Otherwise output `NO`.

## Complexity
Each test case performs only constant-time arithmetic, yielding \(O(1)\) time and \(O(1)\) memory usage.
