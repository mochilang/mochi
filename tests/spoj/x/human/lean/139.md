# SPOJ MAZE - The Long and Narrow Maze

We are given a maze with 3 rows and `n` columns. Each cell contains one of
three tile types:

* `0` – empty, cannot be used,
* `1` – straight pipe (horizontal or vertical),
* `2` – bent pipe (connecting two perpendicular sides).

Each tile may be rotated arbitrarily. The goal is to determine whether we can
rotate tiles so that there exists a continuous path from the left side of the
maze to the right side.

Because the maze has only three rows, we can process it column by column.  For
each column we precompute which entrance row(s) on the left can lead to which
exit row(s) on the right after rotating the three tiles of that column.  There
are only `3^3 = 27` possible column types `(a,b,c)`, so we precompute a table of
transitions for all of them.

During the scan we keep a set of rows that are reachable just to the left of
the current column.  For a column of type `(a,b,c)` we look up its transition
entry and compute the new set of reachable rows on the right.  After processing
all columns, the maze is solvable iff at least one row is reachable at the
right edge.

This algorithm runs in `O(n)` time and uses `O(1)` additional memory.
