# EDIT3 - Editor II

We simulate the text editor directly. The current text is stored in a `String` and
a cursor position `pos` counts how many characters lie to its left.

Operations are processed as follows:

- `Move k` sets `pos := k`.
- `Prev`/`Next` decrement or increment `pos`.
- `Insert n` reads `n` characters, ignoring any line breaks in the input, and
  inserts them after the cursor:
  `text := text.take pos ++ s ++ text.drop pos`.
- `Delete n` removes `n` characters after the cursor using the same splitting
  approach.
- `Get n` prints the substring starting at `pos` with length `n` using
  `text.extract pos (pos + n)`.

Reading for `Insert` is done by repeatedly calling `getLine` until the desired
length is reached, which naturally skips the extra line breaks inserted in the
problem input. This straightforward simulation adheres to the problem's
constraints.
