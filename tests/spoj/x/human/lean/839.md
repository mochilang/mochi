# OPTM - Optimal Marks

For each vertex we must assign a non-negative integer such that
\(\sum_{(u,v)\in E} (mark[u] \oplus mark[v])\) is minimized.
Bits are independent, so we optimize each bit separately.

For a fixed bit we consider only whether a vertex is `0` or `1`.
Vertices with known marks become terminals:
* if the bit of `mark[u]` is `1`, vertex `u` is connected to a super source,
* if the bit is `0`, `u` is connected to a super sink.

All original edges have capacity `1` in both directions.  Running
Edmondsâ€“Karp max flow between source and sink yields a minimum cut.
A vertex is assigned bit `1` iff it is reachable from the source in the
residual graph; otherwise its bit is `0`.  This minimizes the number of
cut edges.  Among all optimal cuts, choosing reachable vertices ensures the
sum of marks is minimal because unforced vertices default to `0` whenever
possible.

Repeating the procedure for all 31 bits gives the optimal marks for every
vertex.
