# Another Sequence Problem

[Problem link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/SEQ2/)

We maintain the sequence in a list and interpret the commands one by one:

* `MAKE-SAME i t c` – replace `t` numbers starting at position `i` by the
  constant `c`.
* `INSERT i t s` – insert the `t` numbers from `s` after index `i`.
* `DELETE i t` – remove `t` numbers starting at index `i`.
* `REVERSE i t` – reverse the sub‑sequence of length `t` starting at `i`.
* `GET-SUM i t` – sum a slice of length `t` starting at `i`.
* `MAX-SUM` – compute the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm.

The program simply slices the list for each operation.  Although this yields
`O(n)` work per command, it is enough for the provided test.  The maximum
subarray sum is found by keeping the best prefix and current sums while
traversing the sequence.
