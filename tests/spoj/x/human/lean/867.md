# Perfect Cubes

Solve [SPOJ CUBES](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CUBES/).

We need all quadruples of integers `a, b, c, d` with
`2 ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d < a ≤ 100` such that `a³ = b³ + c³ + d³`.
The result must list each valid triple in increasing order and grouped by `a`.

## Algorithm

* Iterate `a` from 2 to 100.
* For each `a`, iterate `b` from 2 to `a-1`.
* For each `b`, iterate `c` from `b` to `a-1` and compute `b³ + c³`.
* Iterate `d` from `c` to `a-1` and check whether
  `b³ + c³ + d³ = a³`.
* Whenever equality holds, output the line
  `Cube = a, Triple = (b,c,d)`.

The nested loops guarantee `a` and `b` are processed in ascending order and
that `b ≤ c ≤ d`. With `a ≤ 100` the search space is under
17 million iterations, which runs quickly in Lean.
