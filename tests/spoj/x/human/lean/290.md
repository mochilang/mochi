# [POLYEQ - Polynomial Equations](https://www.spoj.com/problems/POLYEQ/)

## Problem Summary
Given a polynomial \(F(x)\) of degree at most 6 with integer coefficients in the
form of a string, find all real roots of \(F(x)=0\).  Each test case contains one
polynomial.  All roots are guaranteed real and lie in \([-100,100]\).  Output
all roots in non-decreasing order, including multiplicities, each rounded to
within 0.01.

## Algorithm
1. **Parse Polynomial:**
   * Remove spaces, turn every `-` into `+-` and split on `+` to obtain terms.
   * For each term determine its coefficient and degree (handling omitted
     coefficient or exponent).  Accumulate coefficients in an array for powers
     \(0\) through \(6\).
2. **Recursive Root Finding:**
   * For polynomials of degree 1 return the analytical root \(-a_0/a_1\).
   * Otherwise, compute the derivative polynomial and recursively find its
     roots (critical points).  Use \(-100\), critical points, and \(100\) as
     interval boundaries.
   * Scan intervals left to right.  If the polynomial evaluates to zero at a
     boundary, that's a root.  If the values at the ends have opposite signs,
     apply bisection to locate a root within the interval.
   * After finding a root \(r\), divide the polynomial by \((x-r)\) using
     synthetic division and repeat to obtain remaining roots.  This naturally
     yields repeated roots multiple times.
3. **Output:** Round each root to two decimal places and print them separated by
spaces.

## Complexity
The polynomial degree is at most 6, so the recursion and bisection operate on a
small constant size.  Each root is found in logarithmic iterations of bisection,
resulting in effectively constant time per test case.
