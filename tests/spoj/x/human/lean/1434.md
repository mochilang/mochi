# KPEQU - Equation

We are asked to count solutions in positive integers `x` and `y` to
`1/n! = 1/x + 1/y` for a given `n`.

Rearranging gives `n!(x + y) = xy` or `xy - n!x - n!y = 0`.
Adding `n!^2` to both sides factors the equation:

```
(x - n!) (y - n!) = (n!)^2
```

Every positive divisor `d` of `(n!)^2` yields a solution by taking
`x = n! + d` and `y = n! + (n!)^2 / d`.  Conversely, each solution
corresponds to such a divisor pair.  The number of ordered solutions is
therefore equal to the number of positive divisors of `(n!)^2`.

For a prime factorisation `n! = \prod p^{e_p}` the square has
exponents `2e_p`, so the divisor count is `\prod (2e_p + 1)`.
We compute `e_p` using Legendre's formula `e_p = \sum_{k\ge1} \lfloor n / p^k \rfloor`.

Algorithm:

1. Precompute all primes up to `10^4` with a sieve.
2. For each input `n`, compute `e_p` for every prime `p â‰¤ n` and multiply
   `(2*e_p + 1)` into the answer using arbitrary-precision integers.
3. Repeat until a zero is encountered in the input.

The largest `n` is `10^4`, and there are at most 1229 primes up to this
limit, so the procedure is easily fast enough.
