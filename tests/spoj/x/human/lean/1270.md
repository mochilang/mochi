## Problem Summary
Given an n×m grid (1 ≤ n,m ≤ 32) we must fill each cell with `*` or `.` so that each row and column has contiguous blocks of stars whose lengths match the provided sequences. Blocks are separated by at least one dot. Any grid satisfying all constraints is acceptable.

## Algorithm
1. For every row, generate all bitmasks of length `m` that conform to the row's block lengths.
2. Use depth‑first search over the rows, trying each candidate bitmask.
   - While choosing a row pattern, maintain for each column the index of the current block and the number of stars seen in that block.
   - Reject a pattern as soon as it contradicts the column requirements.
3. After all rows are assigned, verify that each column exactly matches its sequence.
4. Output the first grid found, printing rows as `*` and `.` strings.

The bitmask representation and early pruning by column constraints keep the search feasible for the problem bounds.
