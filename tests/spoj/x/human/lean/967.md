# [PB - Parking Bay](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PB/)

## Problem Summary
There are `n` parking slots in a row. Each of the `n` rebels has a preferred slot `P_i`.
Each starship tries to park at its chosen slot, and if it is taken it moves right
until the first free slot. If all slots to the right are occupied, the starship leaves.
We must count how many sequences `P_i` allow all rebels to park.

## Algorithm
The valid preference lists are exactly the **parking functions** of length `n`.
The number of parking functions is known to be `(n + 1)^(n - 1)`.
For each test case we compute this value modulo `10007` using fast modular
exponentiation by repeated squaring.

## Correctness
Let `A_n` be the number of valid sequences for `n` slots. The theory of parking
functions states that `A_n = (n + 1)^(n - 1)`. Our program computes
`(n + 1)^(n - 1) mod 10007`, so the printed value equals `A_n mod 10007` as required.

## Complexity
Modular exponentiation runs in `O(log n)` time per test case and uses `O(1)` extra memory.
