# [POLYCODE - Polygon Encoder](https://www.spoj.com/problems/POLYCODE/)

Given a natural number that encodes a polygon, decode it and compute the polygon's area.

## Algorithm

1. **Decode list length and vertex codes**
   - The encoding is `L(list) = P2(n, Pn(p1 ... pn))` where `P2` is the Cantor pairing function.
   - Use the inverse Cantor pairing to get `n` and the nested tuple code.
   - Repeatedly unpair to recover the sequence `p1 ... pn`.
2. **Decode vertex coordinates**
   - Each vertex code `pi` equals `P2(xi, yi)`; apply inverse pairing to obtain `(xi, yi)`.
3. **Compute area**
   - Apply the shoelace formula on the decoded vertices to get twice the area.
   - Divide by two and format the result with one decimal digit (`.0` or `.5`).

The Cantor pairing and its inverse allow us to reconstruct the original list structure from the single integer. The shoelace formula yields the area in \(O(n)\) time where \(n\) is the number of vertices.
