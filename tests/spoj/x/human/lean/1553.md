## Problem Summary
Given positions of offices along a street, you must connect 2k distinct offices in k pairs using the minimum total length of network cable. Each pair's cable length equals the difference of their positions. Offices are given in sorted order and no office can appear in more than one pair.

## Algorithm
1. Compute the differences between every pair of consecutive offices.
2. Selecting a pair corresponds to choosing one of these differences. Two chosen differences cannot be adjacent because adjacent differences share an office.
3. Use dynamic programming where `dp[i][j]` is the minimal total length using the first `i` differences to form `j` pairs.
   - Skip difference `i`: `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]`.
   - Use difference `i`: `dp[i][j] = dp[i-2][j-1] + diff[i]`.
4. Iterate through the differences maintaining only the last two rows to reduce memory to `O(k)`.
5. The answer is `dp[m][k]` where `m = n-1`.

This runs in `O(n * k)` time and `O(k)` memory.
