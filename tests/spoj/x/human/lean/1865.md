# Making Waves (MKWAVES)

Given samples of a signal `sin(f₁·t) + sin(f₂·t)` at times `t = i/N` for
`i = 1…N`, the task is to recover the two unknown integral frequencies
`f₁` and `f₂` in the range 400–600.  The example reveals that the sine
arguments are measured in degrees, i.e. each sample is
`sin(f·i/N °)`.

To find the frequencies we precompute, for every candidate `f` in the
range, the array of `N` values `sin(f·i/N °)`.  Using these values we also
precompute

* `dot_f = Σ sample_i · sin(f·i/N °)`
* `self_f = Σ sin(f·i/N °)^2`
* `S2 = Σ sample_i^2`

and for each pair `(f,g)` the cross term
`cross_fg = Σ sin(f·i/N °) · sin(g·i/N °)`.

For a candidate pair `(f,g)` the squared error between the measured
samples and the reconstructed signal is

```
SSE = S2 + self_f + self_g + 2·cross_fg − 2·dot_f − 2·dot_g
```

We evaluate this expression for all `201 choose 2` possible pairs and
choose the pair with the smallest error.  The constraints guarantee that
this minimum is achieved at the true frequencies.

This approach requires about 20 million floating‑point operations for
`N = 1000`, which is easily manageable.
