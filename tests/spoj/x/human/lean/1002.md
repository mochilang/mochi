## Problem Summary
Given `N` nephews and `D` distinct CDs, count how many different ways the CDs can be distributed so that each CD goes to exactly one nephew and any nephew may receive zero CDs. Process multiple test cases until the pair `0 0` is encountered.

## Algorithm
For each test case:
1. Read `N` and `D`.
2. If both are zero, terminate.
3. Compute `N^D` using arbitrary-precision arithmetic.
4. Output the result.

Each CD independently has `N` choices of recipients, so the total number of distributions is `N^D`.
