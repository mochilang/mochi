## Problem Summary
Given up to ten test cases. Each test case provides the total number of apples that two girls have together and how many more apples Klaudia has than Natalia. Determine how many apples each girl has.

## Algorithm
1. Repeatedly read the total `s` and difference `d` until EOF.
2. Compute Klaudia's apples as `(s + d) / 2`.
3. Compute Natalia's apples as `(s - d) / 2`.
4. Output the two results on separate lines.

Lean's arbitrary-precision natural numbers handle very large values (up to 10^100) without extra libraries. Each test case runs in constant time.
