# [Build the Fence](https://www.spoj.com/problems/BSHEEP/)

## Problem Summary
Given up to 100,000 sheep positions on a plane (with possible duplicates) for each test case, build the shortest fence that encloses all sheep. The fence is the convex hull. Output the perimeter of the hull rounded to two decimals and the indices of the sheep on the hull starting from the bottommost-leftmost point and going counterclockwise. If only one unique sheep exists, the fence has length 0 and only that index is printed.

## Algorithm
1. Read all points and ignore duplicate coordinates, keeping the first occurrence to preserve indices.
2. Sort the unique points by x then y and run the monotone chain algorithm to compute the convex hull.
3. Rotate the resulting hull so that the first point is the bottommost-leftmost.
4. Compute the perimeter by summing Euclidean distances between consecutive hull points, closing the polygon.
5. Print the perimeter rounded to two decimals and the ordered list of original indices.

This approach runs in \(O(n \log n)\) time per test case and handles up to 100k points efficiently.
