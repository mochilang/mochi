# SUM1SEQ - Sum of one-sequence

We need a sequence `a_1..a_n` such that:

* `a_1 = 0`
* `|a_{i+1} - a_i| = 1`
* `Σ a_i = S`

Let `s_i` be the step between `a_i` and `a_{i+1}` (`±1`).
Then
`a_{i+1} = a_i + s_i` and
```
S = Σ_{i=1}^n a_i = Σ_{i=1}^{n-1} (n - i) * s_i
```
The weights are `n-1, n-2, …, 1`; total weight is
`T = n(n-1)/2`.  A solution exists only if `|S| ≤ T` and `S` has
same parity as `T` (otherwise no combination of `±` weights gives `S`).

To construct a sequence we greedily assign signs starting with the
largest weight.  For current remaining sum `R` and weight `w`, choose
sign `sgn = sign(R)` so that `R := R - sgn*w` reduces the absolute
value.  Continue with `w-1` until `w = 0`; the final `R` becomes `0`.
Reconstruct the actual sequence by applying the chosen steps starting
from `0`.

This greedy works because the weights are consecutive integers, so at
each step the remaining weights can always compensate the leftover.
`O(n)` time and `O(n)` memory are sufficient.
