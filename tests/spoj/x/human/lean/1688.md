# [EASYPROB - A Very Easy Problem!](https://www.spoj.com/problems/EASYPROB/)

Each required number must be written as a sum of powers of two.  For an
exponent greater than one, the exponent itself is expanded recursively in the
same form.  The special cases are `2(0)` for 1 and plain `2` for 2.

## Algorithm
1. Find the largest power of two `2^k` not exceeding `n`.
2. Emit a term using the rules:
   - `k = 0` → `"2(0)"`
   - `k = 1` → `"2"`
   - otherwise → `"2(" ++ repr(k) ++ ")"`
3. Subtract `2^k` from `n` and repeat until the remainder is zero, joining terms
   with `+`.

`repr` is used both for numbers and recursively for exponents.

## Complexity
For an input value `n`, the recursion visits every set bit and for each bit
computes the largest power of two.  Thus the complexity is `O(log n)` per
number, which is trivial for the fixed constants in this task.
