## Problem Summary
Given a number `N`, compute `Z(N)`, the count of trailing zeros in `N!`.

## Algorithm
1. The number of trailing zeros in `N!` equals the exponent of 5 in its prime factorization because factors of 2 are more abundant than 5.
2. Repeatedly divide `N` by 5, adding the quotient to the answer:
   * `k = N / 5`
   * `res += k`
   * `k /= 5` and continue while `k > 0`.
3. Output `res` for each query.

This runs in `O(log_5 N)` time per query.
