# PT07C - The GbAaY Kingdom

The kingdom has `n` cities connected by `m` bidirectional roads. We must
remove roads so that exactly `n-1` remain, the graph stays connected and the
farthest distance between any two cities is minimised.  All edge weights are
non‑negative.

## Algorithm

1. Build an adjacency matrix and run the **Floyd–Warshall** algorithm to obtain
   the shortest path distance `dist[u][v]` for every pair of cities.
2. Check every possible centre of the final tree:
   * **Vertex centre** – for each vertex `v` compute its eccentricity
     `ecc(v) = max_j dist[v][j]`.  A shortest‑path tree rooted at the vertex has
     diameter `2 * ecc(v)`.
   * **Edge centre** – for each edge `(u,v,w)` compute
     `D = max_j (dist[u][j] + dist[v][j]) + w`.  This corresponds to placing the
     centre on the edge.  The minimum of all these values is the optimal tree
     diameter.
3. Reconstruct one optimal spanning tree:
   * For a vertex centre choose, for every other vertex `x`, a neighbour `y`
     such that `dist[root][x] = dist[root][y] + w(x,y)` and connect `x` to `y`.
   * For an edge centre compute
     `delta = dist[u][k] - dist[v][k]`, where `k` is the vertex giving the
     maximal value above.  Each vertex `x` is assigned to the side whose
     distance is closer to the centre and connected to its predecessor on that
     side.  The edge `(u,v)` is added to join the two sides.
4. Output the diameter and the `n-1` chosen edges (with `u < v`).

The complexity is `O(n^3)` from Floyd–Warshall plus linear work to assemble the
answer.
