# [Lazy Cows](https://www.spoj.com/problems/LAZYCOWS/)

## Problem Summary
We are given positions of cows on a 2×B grid. All cows must be covered by at most K
axis-aligned rectangular barns whose edges are parallel to the grid. Barns may not
overlap and their total area should be minimal.

## Algorithm
1. Group cows by column, marking whether each column contains a cow in row 1, row 2, or both.
2. Sort the distinct occupied columns and build prefix counts of how many of these
   columns contain cows in each row.
3. Dynamic programming: `dp[k][i]` stores the minimum area needed to cover the first
   `i` columns using `k` barns.
   For every `i` and `k`, try every possible previous split `j < i`:
   - Width of the new barn is `cols[i-1] - cols[j] + 1`.
   - Height is `1` if cows in that range occupy only one row, otherwise `2`.
   - Update `dp[k][i] = min(dp[k][i], dp[k-1][j] + width * height)`.
4. The answer for each test case is `dp[K][M]`, where `M` is the number of occupied
   columns.

This algorithm runs in `O(K * M^2)` time where `M ≤ N ≤ 1000`.
