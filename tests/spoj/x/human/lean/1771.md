# NQUEEN - Yet Another N-Queen Problem

We are given the board size `N ≤ 50` and for each row either the column of a
preplaced queen or `0` meaning the row is free.  We must output any placement of
`N` queens so that no two attack each other while respecting all preplaced
queens.

## Algorithm

We solve the problem with simple backtracking enhanced with bit masks:

1. Maintain three bit sets for occupied columns and the two diagonals.
   - column bit `c` means column `c` already has a queen.
   - `diag1` uses index `row + col` (\(0 ≤ idx < 2N\)).
   - `diag2` uses index `row + (N - 1 - col)`.
2. Recurse row by row.
   - If a row has a fixed queen we check whether it conflicts with the current
     masks; if not we place it and continue with the next row.
   - Otherwise we iterate over all columns and try the first column that is not
     attacked according to the bit masks.
3. When we reach `row = N` a complete valid arrangement has been found and is
   returned.

Because `N ≤ 50` the bit masks fit easily in a machine integer and the search
finishes quickly for the provided test cases.
