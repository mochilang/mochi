# SPOJ BLINNET - Bytelandian Blingors Network

We are given several test cases.  Each provides a list of cities and the
cost of connecting them with undirected links.  The goal is to connect all
cities with minimal total cost, i.e. compute the cost of a minimum spanning
tree (MST).

The implemented solution uses **Kruskal's algorithm**:

1. Read all edges of the graph.  Every city lists its neighbours and the
   connection cost.  The edges are stored as triples `(u, v, w)`.
2. Sort the edges by increasing cost.
3. Process edges in that order, keeping a disjoint-set union structure to
   detect cycles.  When an edge connects two previously separate components,
   add its cost to the running total and merge the components.
4. The accumulated cost after considering all edges is the MST cost, which
   is printed for each test case.

This approach runs in `O(E log E)` time because of the sorting step and is
well suited to the input limits (up to 10â€‰000 cities).
