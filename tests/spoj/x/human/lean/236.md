# ROMAN - Converting number formats

We must read the number of test cases and, for each case, a positive 32‑bit integer
spelled out digit by digit in English.  Each number is converted to extended
Roman numerals:

* ordinary Roman numerals are used for the last three digits;
* thousands are written in Roman numerals with an overline which multiplies the
  value by 1000;
* digits of the millions block are written in lower case letters, multiplying
  the value by 1,000,000.  If this block is 4000 or more, its leading part is
  itself written with an overline.

For the thousands block we split the value into a multiple of four (which is
rendered with an overline) and the remainder below four (rendered by repeating
`M`).  Underscores printed on a separate line show which letters are overlined.

Parsing input is done by mapping tokens `ZERO`/`OH`…`NINE` to digits and
accumulating a base‑10 number.  Roman conversion is performed by composing
precomputed strings for ones, tens, hundreds and extending the technique for
values up to 4999 to support the leading overline.
