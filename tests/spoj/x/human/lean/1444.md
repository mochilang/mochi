# DEL Command II (DELCOMM2)

Given a set of file names labelled either `+` (should be deleted) or `-` (must be
kept), we can issue exactly one `DEL` command using MS‑DOS wildcards `?` and `*`.
The goal is to delete as many `+` files as possible while ensuring no `-` file is
matched.

## Algorithm

Every pattern that can delete a file originates from generalising one of the
`+` file names.  For a positive name we recursively build all patterns by
processing its characters left to right.  At each step we may:

* keep the character as is,
* replace it by `?`,
* insert `*` before the character (if the previous pattern symbol was not `*`),
* if the previous symbol is `*`, skip the character (the star absorbs it).

At the end of the string we also consider appending a trailing `*`.
This enumeration generates all wildcard patterns that match the chosen
positive file.  For each generated pattern we check whether it matches any
negative file.  If not, we count how many positive files it matches and keep the
maximum.

Wildcard matching is performed by a recursive procedure handling the two
wildcard symbols in the usual way: `?` matches exactly one character and `*`
matches any sequence (possibly empty).

## Correctness

The enumeration explores all patterns that include a given positive file
because every character is either used literally, replaced by `?`, or skipped via
`*`, and `*` can be inserted at any boundary.  Therefore every valid wildcard
that covers a positive file appears in the enumeration of that file.  A pattern
is accepted only if it matches no negative file, so any produced answer deletes
only allowed files.  Among all such patterns we select the one with the highest
count of matched positive files, which is exactly the required maximum.

## Complexity

Let `n` be the maximum length of a file name (≤ 8) and `p` the number of
positive files.  Each enumeration step branches at most four ways, leading to at
most `O(4^n)` patterns per positive file (≈65k for n=8).  For each pattern we
check up to all files (`≤250`), so the overall complexity is acceptable for the
problem limits.
