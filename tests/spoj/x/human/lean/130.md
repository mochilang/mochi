# [Rent your airplane and make money](https://www.spoj.com/problems/RENT)

## Problem Summary
ABEAS Corp owns one airplane and receives rental orders, each with a start time, duration, and offered price. For each test case with up to 10,000 orders, choose a subset of non-overlapping orders that maximizes the total price.

## Algorithm
1. Convert each order to `(start, finish, price)` where `finish = start + duration`.
2. Sort all orders by increasing finish time.
3. Use dynamic programming with binary search:
   - Let `dp[i]` be the best profit using the first `i` orders.
   - For order `i`, binary search the last order `j < i` whose finish time is â‰¤ `start_i`.
   - Set `dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], price_i + dp[j])`.
4. The answer is `dp[n]`, the profit after processing all orders.

Sorting enables `O(log n)` search for compatible orders, giving an overall time complexity of `O(n log n)` per test case.
