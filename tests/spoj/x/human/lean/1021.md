Given a string `S`, insert the minimum number of characters anywhere to turn it into a palindrome.

## Algorithm

- The minimum insertions needed equal `|S| - LPS(S)` where `LPS` is the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.
- Compute `LPS` by finding the longest common subsequence between `S` and its reverse.
- Use dynamic programming with two `O(n)` arrays:
  - For each character of `S`, update a DP row for all characters of the reversed string.
  - Recurrence: if characters match, extend by one; otherwise take the max of left and top values.
- The answer is `n - lcs`, where `n` is the length of the string and `lcs` is the DP result.

This runs in `O(n^2)` time and `O(n)` memory for strings up to length 6100.
