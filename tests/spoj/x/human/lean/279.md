# INUMBER - Interesting number

For a given `n` (≤ 1000) we search for the smallest positive integer that is
both divisible by `n` and whose digits sum to `n`.

We perform a breadth‑first search over states `(r, s)` where `r` is the
remainder modulo `n` of the constructed prefix and `s` is the sum of its
digits. The search starts with single digits `1…9` and extends states by
appending digits `0…9` as long as the new sum does not exceed `n`.
Visiting states in BFS order ensures the first time we reach `(0, n)` gives the
shortest length; processing digits in increasing order also yields the
lexicographically smallest number among those of minimal length.

Parent pointers and the appended digit for each state allow reconstructing the
final number by backtracking from `(0, n)`.

The number of states is at most `n * (n + 1)` (about one million for the
maximum `n`), giving an overall `O(n^2)` time and space complexity.
