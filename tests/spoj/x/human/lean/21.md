# SPOJ TRICENTR - Triangle From Centroid

For a triangle with side lengths $a$, $b$, $c$ and centroid $G$, let
$g_a$, $g_b$, $g_c$ be the perpendicular distances from $G$ to the sides
$a$, $b$, $c$ respectively.  The centroid divides the triangle into three
regions of equal area, hence
$\text{area} = \frac{3}{2} a g_a = \frac{3}{2} b g_b = \frac{3}{2} c g_c$.
Thus knowing $a$ and $g_a$ gives the total area and the remaining sides
are obtained as $b = \frac{2\,\text{area}}{3 g_b}$ and
$c = \frac{2\,\text{area}}{3 g_c}$.

With all side lengths known, the circumradius is
$R = \frac{a b c}{4\,\text{area}}$.  The centroid $G$, circumcenter $O$
and orthocenter $H$ lie on one line and satisfy
$\overline{HG} = 2\,\overline{OG}$.  Moreover
$\overline{OG}^2 = R^2 - \frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{9}$.
Therefore the distance from orthocenter to centroid is
$HG = 2 \sqrt{R^2 - \frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{9}}$.

For each test case we compute the area using $a$ and $g_a$, derive $b$ and
$c$, evaluate $R$ and then $HG$.  The results are printed with three
digits after the decimal point.
