# BONFIRE - Equatorial Bonfire

Problem: <https://www.spoj.com/problems/BONFIRE/>

## Algorithm

We are given several bonfires on the equator.  Fire starts at time `t_i` at
longitude `x_i` and spreads both east and west with speed `v` degrees per
hour.  For every point on the circle the burning time is

```
min_i ( t_i + dist(x, x_i) / v )
```

where `dist` is the shortest circular distance between two longitudes.
The whole equator is burning when this minimum is defined for all `x`.
The task is to find the last point to catch fire and the time when it
happens.

The solution performs a binary search on the time `T`.  For a fixed `T`
we compute, for every bonfire already ignited at or before `T`, the
interval of longitudes that is burning at `T`:
`[x_i - v*(T-t_i), x_i + v*(T-t_i)]` (modulo 360°).  If the union of
these intervals covers the whole `[0,360)` circle then `T` is feasible.
Binary search over `T` finds the minimal such time.

After `T` is found we determine the location.  Every fire reaching its
maximum extent at time `T` has two boundary points.  We test these
endpoints and keep the one where the arrival time equals `T` and whose
longitude is smallest when walking eastwards from the zero meridian.

## Complexity

Let `N` be the number of bonfires (≤ 5000).  Checking coverage for a
fixed time requires sorting at most `2N` intervals, so `O(N log N)`.
Binary search performs a constant number of iterations (≈ 80), therefore
overall time is `O(N log N)` and the memory usage is `O(N)`.
