# 1685 - Grocery store

We search for prices of four items (in cents) such that the sum of the
prices equals their product, with the total not exceeding 20 euros.

Let `a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d` be the four prices in cents.  The relation

```
(a/100) * (b/100) * (c/100) * (d/100) = (a + b + c + d)/100
```

is equivalent to

```
a * b * c * d = (a + b + c + d) * 1_000_000.
```

We iterate over `a`, `b`, and `c` within the bounds imposed by
`a ≤ b ≤ c` and `a + b + c + d ≤ 2000` (20 euros):

- `1 ≤ a ≤ 500` since four equal items of price `a` must fit in the budget.
- `a ≤ b ≤ (2000 - a)/3`.
- `b ≤ c ≤ (2000 - a - b)/2`.

For each triple we compute

```
denom = a*b*c - 1_000_000
num   = (a + b + c) * 1_000_000
```

If `denom > 0` and `num` is divisible by `denom`, we obtain
`d = num / denom`.  We check that `d ≥ c`, `a+b+c+d ≤ 2000`, and the
original equation holds.  Each valid quadruple is printed in
non-decreasing order with two decimal places.

This enumeration yields all 949 possible solutions.
