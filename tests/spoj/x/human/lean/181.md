## Problem Summary
Given required volumes of oxygen `t` and nitrogen `a` and `n` available cylinders described by `(oxygen, nitrogen, weight)`, choose a subset of cylinders whose total oxygen and nitrogen are at least `t` and `a` respectively while minimizing total weight.

## Algorithm
We use dynamic programming over oxygen and nitrogen demands.
1. Create a table `dp[o][n]` for `0 ≤ o ≤ t` and `0 ≤ n ≤ a` initialized to a large value except `dp[0][0] = 0`.
2. For each cylinder `(co, cn, w)` iterate over all states `(o,n)` and update the table:
   - `newO = min(t, o + co)`
   - `newN = min(a, n + cn)`
   - `dp[newO][newN] = min(dp[newO][newN], dp[o][n] + w)`
3. After processing all cylinders the answer is `dp[t][a]`.

## Complexity
`dp` has at most `22 * 80` entries. With up to 1000 cylinders the running time is `O(n * t * a) ≈ 1.8e6` updates and memory usage is `O(t * a)`.
