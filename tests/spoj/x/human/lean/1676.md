We are given up to ten words over uppercase letters. For a given length `L`, count how many strings of that length contain **at least one** of the words as a substring. Results are taken modulo `10007`.

The solution builds an Aho–Corasick automaton for the set of words. Each state represents a prefix of some word and indicates whether a word ends there. We then form an adjacency matrix where `mat[i][j]` counts letters that move from state `i` to state `j` without reaching a terminal state. Raising this matrix to the `L`‑th power gives the number of length‑`L` strings that avoid all words.

Finally, compute `total = 26^L` and subtract the count of avoiding strings. The answer is `(total - avoiding) mod 10007`.

This approach runs in `O(S^3 log L)` where `S` is the number of automaton states (at most ~60 for the given limits).
