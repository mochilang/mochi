# [Periodic Strings](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PERIOD/)

## Problem Summary
For each test case we are given the length `N` and a string `S` of lowercase ASCII letters.
For every prefix of `S` with length `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ N`) we must determine if this
prefix is a concatenation of some string `A` repeated `K` times (`K > 1`).
Whenever such a period exists, we output `i` and `K`.

## Algorithm
1. Convert `S` into an array of characters and compute the **prefix function** `pi`
   used in the Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm.  `pi[i]` is the length of the longest
   proper prefix of `S[0..i]` which is also its suffix.  This can be computed in
   `O(N)` time.
2. For each prefix length `i` from `2` to `N`:
   * Let `p = i - pi[i-1]` be the length of the smallest repeating block.
   * If `i % p == 0` and `i / p > 1`, the prefix has period `K = i / p` and we
     output the pair `i K`.
3. Print an empty line after finishing each test case.

The prefix function requires `O(N)` time and space, and the check over all
prefixes is `O(N)`, so each test case runs in linear time.
