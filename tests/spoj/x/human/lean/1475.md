# [Play with Digit Seven](https://www.spoj.com/problems/WORMS)

## Problem Summary
For each test case an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) is given. Count how many numbers in the range `[1, 10^n]` are *good*, where a number is good if it is divisible by `7` or contains the digit `7`.

## Algorithm
1. Count the complement: numbers in `[1, 10^n]` that are **not** divisible by `7` and do **not** contain digit `7`.
2. Use digit dynamic programming for `n` digits with leading zeros representing numbers from `0` to `10^n - 1`.
   - `dp[r]` stores how many length-`k` prefixes give remainder `r` modulo `7` while avoiding digit `7`.
   - Start with `dp[0] = 1`.
   - For each of the `n` positions update `dp` by trying digits `0..9` except `7` and updating the new remainder `(r*10 + d) % 7`.
3. After processing all digits, `sum_{r=1..6} dp[r]` counts numbers in `0..10^n-1` without digit `7` and not divisible by `7`.
4. Include `10^n` itself (which has no digit `7` and is not divisible by `7`) and subtract from `10^n` to obtain the answer.

This runs in `O(n)` time with constant factors and uses big integers to handle `10^n` for large `n`.
