# MICEMAZE - Mice and Maze

Link: https://www.spoj.com/problems/MICEMAZE/

## Algorithm

1. Read the maze size `N`, exit cell `E`, time limit `T` and number of passages `M`.
2. For each directed passage `a b w` build a reversed edge `b -> a` with weight `w`. Reversing the edges lets us run Dijkstra from the exit cell and obtain the minimum time from every cell to the exit.
3. Run Dijkstra's algorithm with an array-based priority selection (good enough for `N â‰¤ 100`). Repeatedly pick the unused node with smallest distance and relax all outgoing edges.
4. Count how many cells have distance at most `T` and print the count.

The complexity is `O(N^2 + M)`, well within limits for the problem.
