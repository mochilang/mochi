# [Up Subsequence](https://www.spoj.com/problems/UPSUB)

## Problem Summary
Given a string `x` (length ≤ 100) for each test case, list **all** longest non-decreasing subsequences of `x` in lexicographical order. Print a blank line after each test case.

## Algorithm
1. Convert the string to an array of characters and compute `dp[i]`, the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence starting at index `i`.
   - Traverse the array from right to left.
   - For each position `i`, consider all later positions `j` with `x[j] ≥ x[i]` and update `dp[i] = max(dp[i], 1 + dp[j])`.
2. Let `L` be the maximum value in `dp`; this is the length of any maximal upsubsequence.
3. Generate all maximal subsequences recursively:
   - From a starting index and previous character, gather the set of characters that can start a length-`len` subsequence (`dp[i] = len` and `x[i] ≥ prev`).
   - Iterate through these characters in increasing order, pick the earliest occurrence of each, append it to the current prefix, and recurse on the remainder of the string with decremented length.
4. Output each built sequence. After processing one test case, print an empty line.

The DP requires `O(n^2)` time for `n ≤ 100`. The backtracking step enumerates only the maximal subsequences and produces them already sorted lexicographically.
