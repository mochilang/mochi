# Johnny and the Glue

We are given up to 10,000 glue dabs as points on the plane.  Johnny wants to
place a rectangular box so that all dabs lie inside or on the box and every side
of the rectangle touches at least two dabs.  We need to count how many such
rectangles exist.

## Algorithm
1. **Convex hull.**  Only the convex hull matters, because interior points never
determine a supporting side.  We build the hull using the monotonic chain
algorithm while keeping collinear boundary points.
2. **Edge directions.**  For each edge of the hull we normalise its direction and
compute the constant of the line containing it.  For every direction we record
the set of distinct parallel lines that appear on the hull.
3. **Counting rectangles.**  A rectangle exists for a direction `d` when the hull
has two distinct lines parallel to `d` and two distinct lines perpendicular to
`d`.  Each such pair of perpendicular directions contributes one rectangle.  To
avoid double counting we divide the final total by two.

The convex hull takes `O(n log n)` time and the subsequent counting is linear in
the number of hull edges.
