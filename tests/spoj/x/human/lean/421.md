# AROAD - Another Road Problem

We must connect all cities with minimum total cost while the capital (city 1) has at most `d` outgoing roads.

## Algorithm

For a fixed penalty `λ`, add `λ` to the weight of every edge that touches the capital and compute a minimum
spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm.  The number of edges incident to the capital in this tree decreases
as `λ` grows.  This allows a binary search on `λ` to find the smallest value for which the resulting tree uses
at most `d` capital edges.  The real cost of that tree is the sum of original edge weights (the penalty is only
used for ordering).

If even with very large `λ` the graph cannot be connected, no feasible network exists.

## Correctness

*Adding a penalty.*  For any `λ`, consider the MST of the modified weights.  Among all spanning trees, this tree
minimises the sum of modified weights, which equals
`original_cost + λ * (#capital edges)`.

*Binary search.*  Increasing `λ` can only increase the number added to capital edges, so the number of selected
capital edges is non-increasing.  By binary searching on `λ` we find the smallest penalty that yields a connected
spanning tree with at most `d` capital edges.  Because `λ` is minimal, any larger penalty would give a tree with
no lower original cost and still satisfy the constraint.  Thus the tree produced is an optimal solution.

*Impossibility.*  If even with a very large `λ` the graph cannot be connected, every spanning tree requires more
than `d` capital edges, so the answer is `NONE`.

## Complexity

Let `m` be the number of roads and `n` the number of cities.  Each evaluation of `λ` sorts the edges and runs
Kruskal in `O(m log m)`.  Binary search performs `O(log C)` evaluations where `C` is the upper bound on `λ`
(here `C = 20000`).  The overall complexity is `O(m log m log C)`.
