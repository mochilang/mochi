## Problem Summary
Given `n` treasures placed on a line at increasing positions `d_i` with deadlines `t_i`. Starting at any position at time 0 and moving at unit speed, Alibaba must pick each treasure (instantaneous) before its deadline. Determine the minimum possible finishing time to collect all treasures, or report `No solution` if impossible.

## Algorithm
1. The path changes direction at most once; Alibaba either goes left first then right, or right first then left.
2. Precompute prefix and suffix constraints:
   - For a start at position `d_s` going **left first**, deadlines are met when
     - `d_s <= min_{i≤s}(d_i + t_i)` (left side), and
     - `d_s <= min_{j≥s+1}(t_j + 2*d_1 - d_j)` (right side).
     Scan `s` from left to right and pick the smallest feasible `s`. Completion time is `(d_n - d_1) + (d_s - d_1)`.
   - For starting **right first**, deadlines require
     - `d_s >= max_{j≥s}(d_j - t_j)` (right side), and
     - `d_s >= max_{i≤s-1}(2*d_n - d_i - t_i)` (left side).
     Scan from right to left choosing the largest feasible `s`. Completion time is `(d_n - d_1) + (d_n - d_s)`.
3. The answer is the minimum of both directions. If no starting point satisfies the constraints, output `No solution`.

This approach computes prefix minima and suffix maxima in linear time, yielding an overall `O(n)` solution.
