## Problem Summary
Echo each integer from input to output until the sentinel value `42` is read, after which terminate without printing `42` or any subsequent values.

## Algorithm
1. Repeatedly read a line from standard input.
2. Trim whitespace and convert the line to a natural number.
3. If the number is `42`, stop processing.
4. Otherwise, print the number and continue.

This algorithm processes each input number exactly once using constant additional memory.
