# [Remove The String](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PSTRING)

## Problem Summary
For each test case two strings `X` and `Y` are given. Remove the minimum number of characters from `X` so that the resulting string does not contain `Y` as a substring.

## Algorithm
1. Build the KMP prefix table (`lps`) for pattern `Y`.
2. Dynamic programming over the characters of `X` while tracking how many characters of `Y` are currently matched.
   - `dp[j]` is the minimum deletions needed after processing the prefix of `X` and having matched `j` characters of `Y` (0 ≤ j < |Y|).
   - For each character `c` in `X`:
     * Delete it: update `dp[j] + 1` for the same state `j`.
     * Keep it: advance to the next KMP state `ns` if adding `c` does not complete a full match.
3. The answer is the minimum value over all states after processing the entire string.

This runs in `O(|X| · |Y|)` time with at most `10^7` state updates, which fits easily within limits.
