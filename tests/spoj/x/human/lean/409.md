# DEL Command

We are given a list of filenames each prefixed with `-` (to delete) or `+` (to keep).  
The task is to determine whether a single MS-DOS `DEL` command with wildcards can
remove all marked files while leaving the rest untouched.

MS-DOS wildcards use two special characters:

- `?` substitutes exactly one character (except the dot).
- `*` matches any sequence of characters (possibly empty) but may appear only at
  the end of the name or extension.

## Algorithm

1. Separate the files to delete and to keep. Split every filename into name and
   extension.
2. For the delete set build a pattern for the name and another for the
   extension:
   - For each position up to the shortest length, if all characters coincide
     keep that character, otherwise use `?`.
   - If the lengths differ append `*` at the end.
3. Combine the two parts to form the wildcard (`name[.extension]`).
4. Verify that no file marked to keep matches the wildcard; if any does, no
   solution exists.

The construction yields the most specific pattern that still matches all files
scheduled for deletion.  If this pattern also matches a protected file, then no
valid wildcard exists.
