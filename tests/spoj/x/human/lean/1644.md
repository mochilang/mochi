## Problem Summary
Given the heights of `n` trees in a row, the *disorder coefficient* of the arrangement is the sum of absolute differences between heights of consecutive trees. We may swap any two trees at most once. For each position `i`, determine the minimal possible disorder coefficient after optionally swapping the tree at position `i` with any other tree.

## Algorithm
1. Read all tree heights into an array.
2. Define a function `totalCost` that computes the disorder coefficient of an array by summing `|h[i] - h[i+1]|` for all consecutive pairs.
3. For every index `i`:
   - Initialize the best value as the current disorder coefficient of the array.
   - For every index `j`, create a copy of the array with elements at `i` and `j` swapped.
   - Recompute the disorder coefficient of this swapped array.
   - Keep the smallest coefficient observed.
4. Output the best value for each `i` on a separate line.

This bruteâ€‘force approach runs in cubic time but is correct for small inputs used in the tests.
