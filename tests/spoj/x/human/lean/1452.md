# [CAKE - Birthday Cake](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CAKE/)

Given integers `N` and `M`, build a cake consisting of `M` stacked cylinders
with strictly decreasing integer heights and radii.  The total volume must be
`N·π` and we wish to minimise the exposed surface area (all side surfaces plus
the top of the base cylinder).

For radii `r_i` and heights `h_i` the volume constraint is
`∑ r_i^2·h_i = N` and the area to minimise is
`r_1^2 + 2·∑ r_i·h_i`.

## Algorithm
1. Precompute lower bounds:
   - `minVol[k] = ∑_{i=1}^k i^3` — minimal volume achievable by the top `k` layers.
   - `minArea[k] = ∑_{i=1}^k 2·i^2` — minimal lateral area for `k` layers.
2. Depth‑first search placing layers from bottom to top.
   - At recursion level `k` (remaining layers) try radii `r` and heights `h`
     with `k ≤ r < maxR` and `k ≤ h < maxH`.
   - Bounds: `r ≤ √((vol - minVol[k-1]) / k)` and
     `h ≤ (vol - minVol[k-1]) / r²` to keep enough volume for upper layers.
   - The base layer additionally contributes `r²` to the area.
3. Prune branches when
   - remaining volume `< minVol[k]`, or
   - current area plus `minArea[k]` already exceeds the best solution found.

The search space is tiny for `N ≤ 10000` and `M ≤ 10`, so this DFS with
pruning quickly finds the minimal surface area for each test case.
