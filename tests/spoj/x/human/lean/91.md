# TWOSQRS - Two squares or not two squares

[Problem link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TWOSQRS/)

We must decide for each `n` whether it can be expressed as a sum of two integer squares.
By Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares, this happens iff in the prime factorization
of `n` every prime congruent to `3 (mod 4)` occurs with an even exponent.

Algorithm:
1. Factor `n` by trial division from `2` upward while `p * p <= n`.
2. For each factor `p` we count its exponent `e`.
   If `p % 4 == 3` and `e` is odd, the answer is `No`.
3. After the loop, if the remaining `n` is `3 (mod 4)` then `No`; otherwise `Yes`.

Each test case thus runs in `O(sqrt n)` time, which is fine for `n \le 10^{12}` and at most
100 cases.
