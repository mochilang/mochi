# SPOJ 344 - Poker

Given five poker cards we determine the best hand category.

## Algorithm

1. Map ranks to numbers: A=14, K=13, Q=12, J=11, T=10, 9..2 to their values.
2. Count how many of each rank appear using an array of size 15.
3. Sort the ranks to check for straights.  A special case recognizes `A 2 3 4 5`.
4. Determine if all suits match (`flush`).
5. Based on the sorted ranks, the straight flag and the frequency counts, choose
   the hand in the order:
   royal flush → straight flush → four of a kind → full house → flush →
   straight → three of a kind → two pairs → pair → high card.

## Correctness

The frequency counts capture how many cards share the same rank.  The sorted
ranks and straight test check consecutive sequences, including the low-ace
case.  Checking the above conditions in the specified order mirrors the poker
hand hierarchy, so the program outputs the exact category for every possible
set of five cards.

## Complexity Analysis

Sorting five ranks and computing counts both take constant time.  Therefore
processing each hand runs in `O(1)` time.
