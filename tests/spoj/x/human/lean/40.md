## Problem Summary
Given a simple polygon defined by its vertices in order, find the coordinates of its center of gravity. The polygon may be non-convex and coordinates may be negative. Output the centroid rounded to two decimals.

## Algorithm
1. Iterate through all edges of the polygon keeping the first vertex to close the polygon.
2. For each edge from `(xi, yi)` to `(xj, yj)` compute the cross product `cross = xi*yj - xj*yi` and accumulate:
   - `area2 += cross`
   - `cx += (xi + xj) * cross`
   - `cy += (yi + yj) * cross`
3. After processing all edges, the centroid is:
   - `gx = cx / (3 * area2)`
   - `gy = cy / (3 * area2)`
4. Round each coordinate to two decimal places.

The above uses the standard centroid formula for polygons and works for both clockwise and counterclockwise vertex orderings.
