## Problem Summary
Given a set of up to 1000 points in the plane for each photograph, find the maximum number of points that lie on a common straight line. If at least four points are collinear, assume they come from a train and remove them; otherwise remove none. For each photo report how many points were removed.

## Algorithm
1. For each point *i*, compute slopes to all later points *j>i*.
2. Represent a slope by the reduced pair `(dy, dx)`. Divide `dy` and `dx` by `gcd(|dy|,|dx|)` and normalize so `dx ≥ 0` (vertical lines use `(1,0)`).
3. Count occurrences of each slope in a hash map; the highest count plus one (for point *i* itself) gives the number of collinear points through *i*.
4. Track the overall maximum over all base points. If this maximum is at least 4, output it; otherwise output 0.

The algorithm runs in O(n²) time per test case and uses O(n) extra memory.
