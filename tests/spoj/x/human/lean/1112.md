## Problem Summary
Given coordinates `(x, y)` with `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 10000`, output the number located at that point in a diagonal numbering pattern starting from `(0,0)` or output `No Number` if the point is not labelled.

## Algorithm
1. For each test case, read integers `x` and `y`.
2. If `x == y` or `x == y + 2` then:
   - If `x` is even, the number is `x + y`.
   - Otherwise, the number is `x + y - 1`.
3. Otherwise, print `No Number`.

The pattern forms two diagonals on the grid, so the formula above computes the label in constant time.
