## Problem Summary
Given all sides of a convex polygon and a set of non-crossing diagonals, recover the order of the vertices around the polygon. Each dataset lists `n` vertices and `m` diagonals, followed by `n + m` pairs describing the edges (sides or diagonals). The goal is to output a permutation of `1..n` representing the polygon's border starting from vertex `1` and choosing the smaller of its two neighbours as the second vertex.

## Algorithm
1. Build adjacency sets for the undirected graph defined by the input edges.
2. Repeatedly remove an *ear* — a vertex of degree at most two — from the graph. When removing vertex `v` with neighbours `a` and `b`, record `(v, a, b)` and connect `a` and `b` with an edge if it does not already exist. This continues until only two vertices remain.
3. Reconstruct the polygon by inserting the removed vertices back in reverse order between their recorded neighbours, effectively undoing the ear removals.
4. Starting from vertex `1`, traverse the reconstructed cycle in the direction where the second vertex is the smaller of its two neighbours and print the sequence.

The ear removal runs in linear time because each edge is considered a constant number of times. The reconstruction step is also linear, yielding an overall `O(n)` algorithm.
