# [DNA Translation](https://www.spoj.com/problems/DNA/)

## Problem Summary
Given a DNA strand, determine the protein sequence generated from it.
The strand may represent either DNA half and can be provided in forward or reverse order.
If no valid protein can be produced, output `*** No translatable DNA found ***`.

## Algorithm
1. Generate four possible mRNA sequences:
   - transcription of the given strand,
   - transcription of the reversed strand,
   - transcription of the complement,
   - transcription of the reversed complement.
   Transcription replaces `T` with `U` and, when needed, complements bases (`A↔T`, `C↔G`).
2. For each mRNA sequence:
   - scan for a start codon `AUG`;
   - from the next codon onward, translate three-letter codons using the genetic code
     until a stop codon (`UAA`, `UAG`, `UGA`) is reached;
   - if translation succeeds with at least one amino acid, emit the sequence
     (abbreviations joined by `-`).
3. If none of the four orientations yields a valid translation, print the failure message.

This approach checks at most four sequences and scans each at most once, so the
complexity is `O(n)` per input strand where `n` is its length.
