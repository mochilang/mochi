# SPOJ ASSIGN4 - Another Assignment Problem

We have `m` worker types with supplies `a_i` and `n` task types with demands `b_j`.  Assigning a worker of type `i` to task `j` costs `C_{ij}`.  The total supply equals the total demand, and we must fill all positions at minimum cost.

## Algorithm

This is a balanced transportation problem.  Build a flow network:

- Source → worker `i` with capacity `a_i` and cost 0.
- Worker `i` → task `j` with capacity `a_i` and cost `C_{ij}`.
- Task `j` → sink with capacity `b_j` and cost 0.

The minimum-cost way to send flow from source to sink equals the desired assignment cost.  We compute it using a successive shortest augmenting path algorithm with potentials (min-cost max-flow).  Each iteration runs Dijkstra on reduced costs and augments by the minimum residual capacity along the path.

## Complexity

Let `V = m + n + 2` and `E = m · n + m + n`.  Dijkstra with an O(V²) loop is sufficient since `V ≤ 402`.  The overall complexity is `O(V² · E)` in the worst case, which fits comfortably within the constraints (`m, n ≤ 200`).
