## Problem Summary
Given an integer `t` followed by `t` values `k`, output the k-th positive integer whose cube ends with the digits `888`.

## Algorithm
The sequence of numbers whose cubes end in `888` forms an arithmetic progression: `192, 442, 692, 942, ...`.
The pattern can be derived from checking that `(250n + 192)^3` always ends with `888` for any `n >= 0`.
Thus the k-th term is computed directly as:

```
192 + (k - 1) * 250
```

For each test case, read `k`, evaluate the formula above, and print the result.
This solution runs in O(1) time per test case and uses constant additional memory.
