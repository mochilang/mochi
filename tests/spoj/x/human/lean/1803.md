# FOLD - Fold

We are given the unfolded description of a folded strip of paper.  Each test
case is a string of `A` and `V` representing the creases.  The length of the
string is the number of turns along the strip.

The strip is finally folded into a stack of length one stripe.  Each folding
step can at most double the number of stripes: when unfolding a fold, every
existing stripe may produce at most two stripes.  If the final unfolded strip
has `n + 1` stripes (i.e. `n` turns), any sequence of folds must therefore
satisfy `2^k >= n + 1`, where `k` is the number of folds.  Hence at least
`ceil(log2(n + 1))` folds are necessary.

This bound is also achievable.  By always folding the current stack roughly in
half we can double the number of stripes each time, so with `ceil(log2(n + 1))`
folds we can reach any required number of stripes and, by choosing folding
directions appropriately, reproduce the given pattern of `A` and `V`.

Therefore the minimal number of folding steps is simply `ceil(log2(n + 1))`.
