# [String it out](https://www.spoj.com/problems/SUBS)

## Problem Summary
Given strings `X` and `Y`, find the largest integer `M` such that the string formed by repeating each character of `X` exactly `M` times, denoted `X^M`, is a subsequence of `Y`.

## Algorithm
1. Convert `X` and `Y` to lists of characters.
2. Compute an upper bound for `M` using letter frequencies: for each letter `c`, `M` cannot exceed `count_Y(c) / count_X(c)`.
3. Binary search `M` from `0` up to this bound.
4. To check a candidate `M`, scan `Y` once keeping track of how many times each character of `X` has been matched. When `M` matches of a character are found, move to the next character of `X`. If all characters of `X` are matched in order, the candidate `M` is feasible.
5. The maximum feasible `M` from the binary search is the result.

This runs in `O(|Y| log M)` time per test case and uses `O(1)` extra space aside from the input strings.
