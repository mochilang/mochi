# [Decoding Morse Sequences](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MORSE/)

## Problem Summary
Given a Morse code string and a dictionary of words, count how many distinct phrases of dictionary
words encode exactly to the given string. Words are encoded with standard Morse letters and
concatenated without separators; the entire string must be covered.

## Algorithm
1. Map each letter `A`-`Z` to its Morse representation.
2. Convert every dictionary word to its Morse code and group these codes by their length.
3. Let `dp[i]` denote the number of ways to parse the suffix starting at position `i` of the Morse
   sequence. Set `dp[n] = 1` for the empty suffix.
4. For `i` from `n-1` downto `0`, check each distinct code length `L`:
   - If the substring `s[i:i+L]` is a dictionary code of length `L`, add `dp[i+L]` to `dp[i]`.
5. The answer is `dp[0]`.

At most 80 distinct lengths exist (20 letters Ã— 4 symbols per letter), so the algorithm runs in
`O(n * L)` time with `O(n)` memory, where `n` is the Morse sequence length.
