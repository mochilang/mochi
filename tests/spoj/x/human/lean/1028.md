## Problem Summary
Two players, Airborne and Pagfloyd, play a game with N numbered pieces. A move chooses a remaining number x and removes x and any divisors of x still present. Whoever removes the last piece wins. Given N and the starting player (0 for Airborne, 1 for Pagfloyd), determine the winner assuming optimal play.

## Algorithm
The initial set {1,…,N} with N ≥ 1 is always a winning position for the player to move: any move leaves a non‑empty position that the next player cannot force back to a previous state. Thus the winner is simply the starting player.

For each test case:
1. Read N and the starting indicator s.
2. If s = 0 output `Airborne wins.`
3. Otherwise output `Pagfloyd wins.`

The computation is O(1) per test case.
