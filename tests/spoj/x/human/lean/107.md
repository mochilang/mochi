# [Calendar of the Maya](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MAYACAL/)

## Problem Summary
Given a Calendar Round date (Tzolkin day number and name, Haab day number and month), list all corresponding Long Count dates in baktuns 8 and 9, or output 0 if the Calendar Round date is illegal.

## Algorithm
1. Map day and month names to indices. Store month lengths (20 days, except Wayeb with 5).
2. Precompute the Calendar Round for each of the 288,000 days spanning baktuns 8â€“9, treating `8.0.0.0.0` as day 0 with known Calendar Round `9 Ajaw 3 Sip`.
3. For a given input date, verify day numbers are in valid range and search the precomputed sequence for matches of both Tzolkin and Haab components.
4. For each matching day, convert the absolute day count to Long Count components via successive division (144000, 7200, 360, 20) and output in ascending order.
5. If no match exists, output `0`.

## Correctness
- The Tzolkin cycle repeats every 260 days and the Haab cycle every 365 days. The combined Calendar Round repeats every lcm(260,365)=18,980 days.
- Enumerating 288,000 days (two baktuns) guarantees all legal Calendar Round combinations appear in this range.
- The reference `8.0.0.0.0 = 9 Ajaw 3 Sip` lets us determine the Calendar Round for any offset day, ensuring comparisons are correct.
- Long Count conversion uses exact base units, so the resulting tuples represent the same absolute day numbers.

## Complexity
Processing each test case requires scanning 288,000 days and constant-time arithmetic per day, giving `O(288000)` time and `O(1)` extra space.
