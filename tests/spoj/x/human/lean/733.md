# MTWALK - Mountain Walking

Farmer John wants a path from the top-left to bottom-right of an \(N \times N\) grid
such that the difference between the highest and lowest visited elevations is
minimal.

## Algorithm

1. Read the elevation grid and note the minimal and maximal heights.
2. Binary search the answer `d` – the allowed range width.
3. For a fixed `d`, try every possible lower bound `lo` from `min` to `max`:
   - Let `hi = lo + d`.
   - Run BFS from the start, moving only through cells whose height is in
     `[lo, hi]`.
   - If the destination is reachable for some `lo`, the width `d` is feasible.
4. The smallest feasible `d` is printed.

`N ≤ 100` and heights are in `[0,110]`, so the BFS over the grid is cheap and
checking all ranges with binary search stays fast.
