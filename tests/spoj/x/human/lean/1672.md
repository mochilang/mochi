# The Great Indian Wedding (GIWED)

We are given an `M × N` park with up to `K ≤ 50` rectangular carpets that block water
flow.  Water from a pipe spreads horizontally and vertically until it hits a carpet
or the park boundary.  With at most `L` pipes we may water at most `L` connected
regions of free ground.  The goal is to maximize the watered area.

## Algorithm

1. **Coordinate compression** – Collect all distinct `x` and `y` coordinates from
   the park borders and carpet edges.  After sorting and deduplicating there are
   at most `2K + 2 ≤ 102` coordinates in each axis.  The park is partitioned into
   a grid of at most `101 × 101` rectangles where each cell is either completely
   free or completely covered by carpets.
2. **Mark blocked cells** – For each carpet, mark all grid cells whose rectangle
   lies inside it as blocked.
3. **Connected components** – Iterate over the grid and perform a DFS over the
   free cells.  The area of a cell is `(x[i+1] - x[i]) * (y[j+1] - y[j])`.  Sum the
   areas of cells in each component and store them.
4. **Choose pipes** – Sort component areas in descending order and sum the
   largest `L` of them.  This is the maximal waterable area because a single pipe
   suffices to cover an entire connected component.

The complexity is dominated by the `101 × 101` grid and is therefore tiny.
