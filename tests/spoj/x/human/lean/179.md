## Problem Summary
Given an equation built from binary digits and variables of fixed length, count how many assignments of binary words to the variables make both sides evaluate to the same binary word.

## Algorithm
1. For each variable `v` with length `len[v]`, treat every position of `v` as a separate unknown bit.
2. Expand both sides of the equation into sequences of these bit positions and constants `0` or `1` using the given variable lengths.
3. Build a Union-Find (DSU) over all variable positions plus two special nodes for the constants `0` and `1`.
4. Traverse the expanded sequences in parallel and union the corresponding positions. If the sets containing `0` and `1` ever merge, the equation has no solution.
5. After processing all constraints, each DSU component not fixed to `0` or `1` represents a free bit that can take two values. If there are `f` such components, the number of solutions is `2^f`.

This runs in `O(L Î±(L))` time where `L` is the total expanded length of both sides of the equation.
