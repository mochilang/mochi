# Solution for SPOJ CPRMT - Common Permutation

[Problem Link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CPRMT/)

## Algorithm

1. For each input pair of strings `a` and `b`:
   - Count frequency of each lowercase letter in `a` and in `b` using arrays of size 26.
   - For every letter 'a'..'z', take the minimum count from the two arrays.
   - Append that letter repeated this minimum number of times to the result.
   - The letters are processed in alphabetical order, so the output is lexicographically ordered.
2. Print the resulting string for each pair; stop at end of file.

## Correctness Proof

For any lowercase letter `c`, let `count_a(c)` and `count_b(c)` denote its occurrences in `a` and `b`. Any permutation of `x` that is a subsequence of `a` must use at most `count_a(c)` copies of `c`, and similarly at most `count_b(c)` copies for `b`. Therefore the number of copies of `c` in any valid `x` is bounded above by `min(count_a(c), count_b(c))`.

The algorithm constructs `x` exactly with `min(count_a(c), count_b(c))` copies of each `c` and no other letters. Thus `x` is a permutation that can be formed as a subsequence of both `a` and `b`, and any other valid string cannot contain more occurrences of any letter. The output is unique because letters are emitted in alphabetical order.

## Complexity Analysis

Let `n` be the length of `a` and `m` be the length of `b`. Counting letters is `O(n + m)`; constructing the result iterates over 26 letters and is `O(26)` ≈ `O(1)`. Therefore each test case runs in `O(n + m)` time and uses `O(1)` additional space.
