# WATER - Water among Cubes

We are given up to 100×100 grid of column heights. Water collects in low cells that are not connected to the boundary. This is the classic "trapping rain water in 2D" problem.

## Algorithm

1. Mark all boundary cells as visited and insert them into a priority structure (a simple list where the minimum height is extracted each iteration).
2. While the structure is not empty:
   - Remove the cell with the smallest height.
   - For each unvisited neighbour:
     - Any water above it is the difference between the current height and the neighbour’s height, if the current is higher.
     - Push the neighbour with height `max(current height, neighbour height)` and mark it visited.
3. Accumulate the trapped water amounts and print the total for each test case.

This simulates filling the terrain from the lowest boundary upwards using a Dijkstra-like expansion.
