# Direct Visibility (DIRVS)

## Algorithm

1. Parse the grid and BTS coordinates.
2. Perform a breadth‑first search from the first BTS.
3. A move to a neighbouring cell is allowed only when:
   * the height difference is within +1 / −3 metres;
   * from the new cell at least one BTS is visible.  Visibility is checked
     by sampling points along the straight segment connecting the cell and
     the BTS and ensuring the segment stays above the terrain.
4. The BFS returns the minimal number of steps to reach the second BTS, or
   reports failure when no such path exists.

## Complexity

Let `P × Q` be the grid size.  Each cell is visited at most once, and
visibility checking scans a number of points proportional to the distance
between the cell and each BTS.  The total time is roughly
`O(P·Q·max(P,Q))` and the memory usage is `O(P·Q)`.
