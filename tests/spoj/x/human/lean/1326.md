# [A Chase In WonderLand](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CHASE)

## Problem Summary
Given up to 2200 points representing safe spots on a pool of quicksand,
Alice can step onto any spot from the shore and then must continue
jumping in a straight line without turning back.  For each test case,
determine the maximum number of jumps she can make.

## Algorithm
1. Read all points for a test case.
2. For each point `p`, compute normalized direction vectors `(dx, dy)` to
   every other point `q` and count how many share the same direction using
   a hash map.
   - The vector is reduced by the GCD of `dx` and `dy` and its sign is
     normalized so `(dx, dy)` and `(-dx, -dy)` represent the same line.
3. The maximum number of collinear points through `p` is
   `best + duplicates + 1`, where `best` is the highest count in the map
   and `duplicates` counts points identical to `p`.
4. Track the global maximum number of collinear points across all choices
   of `p`.  The answer is this maximum minus one (since jumps are between
   points).

This runs in `O(n^2)` time per test case and uses `O(n)` additional memory.
