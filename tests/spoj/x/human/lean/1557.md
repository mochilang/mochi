# GSS2 - Can you answer these queries II

We are given an array of scores.  For every query `[L, R]` we must
find the maximum total score obtainable from a contiguous subarray
contained in that range, with the restriction that each score may
appear at most once in the chosen subarray.  Negative scores can be
ignored because we may always pick an empty subarray yielding score 0.

For a fixed range we scan it with a sliding window.  The window covers
a candidate subarray of distinct scores.  We keep a map from a score
to its most recent index.  When a repeated score is encountered we
shrink the window from the left until the previous occurrence is
removed.  During this process we maintain the current sum of the
window and the best sum seen so far.  The window always contains only
distinct values, therefore the best sum recorded over the scan is the
answer for that range.

For each query we run this scan over its subarray, yielding an
`O(R-L+1)` solution per query.  The sample constraints are small so
this approach is sufficient for the exercise.
