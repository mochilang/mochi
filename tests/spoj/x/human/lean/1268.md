# [CN Tower (Easy)](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CNEASY)

## Problem Summary
Given the compass bearings of landmarks around the CN Tower, determine the
minimum time Christy must stay in the rotating restaurant so that every
landmark comes into view. The restaurant completes a full 360° rotation in
72 minutes (12 seconds per degree). She may choose the starting angle before
beginning to take pictures.

## Algorithm
1. Read all landmark angles and convert them to hundredths of a degree.
2. Sort the angles and compute the gap between each consecutive pair,
   treating the list as circular (include the wrap‑around gap from the last
   angle back to the first plus 360°).
3. The restaurant needs to rotate through all angles except the largest gap.
   Thus the minimal span is `360° - max_gap`.
4. Multiply this span by 12 seconds per degree and round up to the nearest
   whole second.

This requires sorting the angles and scanning once, yielding an overall
`O(n log n)` time complexity and `O(1)` extra space beyond the input list.
