# [CHOCOLA - Chocolate](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CHOCOLA)

## Problem Summary
We have an \(m \times n\) chocolate bar that must be broken into single squares. Each potential vertical or horizontal cut has a fixed cost independent of the piece size. Breaking a piece along a line multiplies that line's cost by the number of existing segments in the perpendicular direction. Find the minimum total cost to split the bar into \(m \times n\) squares.

## Algorithm
1. Read \(m\), \(n\), then the \(m-1\) vertical cut costs and \(n-1\) horizontal cut costs.
2. Sort both cost lists in descending order.
3. Maintain counts of current pieces: `h = 1` horizontal segments and `v = 1` vertical segments.
4. Repeatedly choose the larger next cost:
   - If the next vertical cost is greater, add `cost * h` to the total and increment `v`.
   - Otherwise add `cost * v` and increment `h`.
5. After one list is exhausted, process the remaining costs with the same rule.
6. Output the accumulated total.

Choosing the most expensive remaining cut first is optimal because earlier cuts have smaller multipliers. The algorithm runs in \(O((m+n) \log (m+n))\) time due to sorting.
