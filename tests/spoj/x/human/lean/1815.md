# SPOJ WA - Problems Collection (Volume X)

Each of the ten subproblems has an independent answer:

1. Let $Q(x)=P(x)-2007x$.  Since $Q(k)=0$ for $k=1,2,3,4$, $Q(x)$ has
   $(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)(x-4)$ as a factor.  Thus $Q(10)-Q(-5)$ equals this
   product times $(10-(-5))$.  Adding the linear term gives
   $P(10)-P(-5)=75465$.
2. With fixed positive integers summing to $2007$, the sum of squares is
   maximised when one number takes the remainder and the rest are $1$.
   Hence $1908^2+99=3640563$.
3. Build the concatenated number from $100$ to $500$ digit by digit while
   taking the remainder modulo $126$.
4. Splitting the geometric series into blocks of seven terms shows
   $S_{14}=S_7(1+r^7)$ and $S_{21}-S_{14}=r^{14}S_7$.  Eliminating $r$
   yields $S_7(S_{21}-S_{14})=2007^2$.
5. Search for $n\ge4$ and $m$ such that $(m+n-4)! = n!\cdot(m-1)!$.
   The valid $n$ are $6,7,23$ and their sum is $36$.
6. Using a centre--vector parametrisation of a square, solving the system
   for points on $y=2x-17$ and $y=x^2$ gives two areas: $80$ and $1280$.
   Their sum is $1360$.
7. Any tetrahedron can be completed to a parallelepiped in three distinct
   ways, so exactly $3$ parallelepipeds contain the four given points.
8. If $r$ is a root of $x^2-x-1$, then $r^n=F_n r+F_{n-1}$ where $F_n$
   are Fibonacci numbers.  Setting $P(r)=0$ for $r^{16}$ and $r^{17}$
   gives $a_1=987$, $a_2=-1597$, so $a_1a_2=-1576239$.
9. Expressing everything in terms of $\tan x$ reduces the expression to a
   function minimised at $x=\pi/4$ with value $4$.
10. Solving $5(x+1/x)=12(y+1/y)=13(z+1/z)$ with $xy+yz+zx=1$ yields
    $(x,y,z)=(1/5,2/3,1)$ and $x^4+y^4+z^4=60706/50625$, so $m+n=111331$.
