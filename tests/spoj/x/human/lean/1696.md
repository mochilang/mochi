# Will Indiana Jones Get There

We model every wall section as an axis‑aligned segment.  Moving between two
segments requires a board whose length is at least the shortest Euclidean
distance between them.  Indiana can walk along a wall and cross between walls
as long as the board length is sufficient.

To find the minimal board length between the starting wall (first segment) and
the target wall (second segment) we:

1. Compute the distance for every pair of segments.  For two segments the
   horizontal and vertical gaps determine the Euclidean distance
   `sqrt(dx² + dy²)` (zero if projections overlap).
2. Treat segments as vertices of a complete graph weighted by these distances.
   Sort all edges by weight and perform a Kruskal-style union‑find.  As soon as
the sets containing the first two segments become connected, the current edge
weight is the minimal necessary board length.

The algorithm processes `O(n^2)` edges and sorting dominates the runtime at
`O(n^2 log n)` with `n ≤ 1000`, which easily fits within the constraints.
