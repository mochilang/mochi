# SCITIES - Selfish Cities

We are given two disjoint sets of cities: sellers (size `C1`) and buyers (size `C2`).
Each ordered triple `(c1, c2, g)` states that seller `c1` can sell `g` goods to buyer `c2`.
Every seller can sell to at most one buyer and every buyer can buy from at most one seller.
The task is to choose such pairs so that the total amount of exchanged goods is maximized.

This is the **assignment problem** for a bipartite graph with weights.
We build a `C1 × C2` matrix `A` where `A[i][j]` is the amount of goods `i` can sell to `j`
(or `0` if no edge exists).  The maximal total is computed using the Hungarian algorithm
for maximum weight matching.  The algorithm maintains dual potentials for rows and
columns and iteratively augments the matching with the cheapest (here: most profitable)
augmenting path.

The implementation pads the matrix to a square one, runs the algorithm in `O(n^3)` time,
where `n = max(C1, C2)`, and returns the sum of the selected entries.  This satisfies the
original constraints (`C1, C2 ≤ 100`).
