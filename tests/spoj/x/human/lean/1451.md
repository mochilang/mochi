# SEQ1 - 01 Sequence

Given integers `N`, `A0`, `B0`, `L0`, `A1`, `B1`, `L1`, find a binary string of length `N` or report `-1` if none exists.  The string must satisfy two sliding-window constraints:

- In every substring of length `L0`, the count of `0`s lies between `A0` and `B0`.
- In every substring of length `L1`, the count of `1`s lies between `A1` and `B1`.

Exactly five test cases are supplied and each answer is printed on its own line.

## Algorithm

We build the string recursively.

1. Start with an empty array and grow it one character at a time.
2. When appending a candidate character we verify the constraints on the windows ending at the new position. For each window type we count the appropriate symbol in the suffix of length `L0` or `L1`.
3. If the counts exceed the upper bounds or, once the window is full, fall below the lower bounds, that branch is pruned.
4. We try `'0'` before `'1'`, so the first valid sequence found is returned. If neither choice leads to a full length `N` sequence, the result is `-1`.

The search is exponential in the worst case but is adequate for the small inputs used in the tests.
