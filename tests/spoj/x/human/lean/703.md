# SERVICE - Mobile Service

We keep track of the locations of the three employees while processing the
sequence of requests.  After a request is served one employee is fixed at the
requested location, therefore the state of the system is completely determined
by the positions of the other two employees.

Let `dp[a][b]` be the minimal cost after serving the current request when the
other two employees occupy locations `a` and `b` (the employee that served the
last request is implicitly at the request location).  The pair is stored in
sorted order, so employees are indistinguishable.

For the next request `r` we examine the following cases:

* `r` already has an employee – simply permute the state so the request
  location becomes the new “current” location.
* Otherwise choose one employee to move to `r`.  The move costs
  `C(x, r)` where `x` is the origin location.  We update the appropriate
  state accordingly.

The transition iterates over all currently reachable states (at most `L^2` of
them) and produces the states for the next request.  Processing all `N`
requests therefore costs `O(N·L^2)` operations.

The result is the minimum value in the table after the final request.
