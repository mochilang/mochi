# [The lightest language](https://www.spoj.com/problems/LITELANG/)

## Problem Summary
Given an alphabet with `k` letters where each letter has an associated positive weight, find the minimal possible total weight of a prefix-free language consisting of `n` words. The weight of a word is the sum of weights of its letters and the weight of a language is the sum of its word weights.

## Algorithm
1. Read `n`, `k` and the weights of the `k` letters.
2. Determine how many times we must expand the prefix tree so that we have at least `n` leaves:
   - Each expansion of a leaf replaces it with `k` children, increasing the number of leaves by `k-1`.
   - The minimal number of expansions is `ceil((n-1)/(k-1))`.
3. Maintain the current leaves in an array.
   - Repeatedly find and remove the leaf with the smallest weight and expand it by appending `k` new leaves obtained by adding each letter weight.
4. After all expansions, sort the list of leaf weights and sum the smallest `n` of them.
5. Output this sum as the minimal total weight.

The expansion step runs in `O(n * k)` and the final sorting costs `O(n log n)`, which is sufficient for the constraints (`n ≤ 10⁴`, `k ≤ 26`).
