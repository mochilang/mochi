## Problem Summary
Determine the organizer of an explosion given statements from M people. Exactly N of them are liars and the others are truthful. Each relevant statement asserts someone's guilt or the current day of the week. Exactly one person is guilty.

## Algorithm
1. Parse all names and retain only useful statements of the following forms:
   - "I am guilty." / "I am not guilty."
   - "X is guilty." / "X is not guilty."
   - "Today is <Day>."
2. Enumerate every candidate guilty person, every subset of N liars among the M people, and each of the seven possible days.
3. For a combination to be valid, every statement from a truthful person must be true and every statement from a liar must be false under that assignment.
4. Collect all guilty persons that appear in at least one valid assignment.
5. Output the sole candidate if unique, `Cannot Determine` if multiple candidates remain, or `Impossible` if no assignment satisfies all constraints.

This brute-force search is feasible because M ≤ 11 and P ≤ 30, keeping the search space under a few tens of thousands combinations.
