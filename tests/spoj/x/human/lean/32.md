# [A Needle in the Haystack](https://www.spoj.com/problems/NHAY/)

## Problem Summary
Read multiple test cases, each consisting of a needle and a haystack. For each case output all starting positions (0-indexed) where the needle occurs in the haystack. Separate outputs for successive test cases with an empty line.

## Algorithm
1. Convert the needle to an array of characters and build its LPS (longest prefix suffix) table.
2. Scan the haystack using the Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm:
   - Compare characters of haystack and needle.
   - On mismatch, jump within the needle using the LPS table instead of restarting from the beginning.
   - When the entire needle matches, record the starting index and continue using the LPS value to allow overlaps.
3. Print each recorded index on its own line followed by a blank line after each test case.

This runs in linear time `O(n + m)` for a needle of length `m` and haystack of length `n`.
