# [MMIND - The Game of Master-Mind](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MMIND/)

We must generate a secret code consistent with previous guesses and their
hints in the Master-Mind game.  Each hint consists of:

* **B** – number of pins that have the right colour in the right position;
* **W** – number of pins with the right colour but wrong position.

For every test case we are given `P` (code length), `C` (number of colours)
and `M` previous guesses.  We must output the lexicographically smallest code
that matches all hints or the sentence `You are cheating!` when no code
satisfies all hints.

## Algorithm

Because `P ≤ 10` we perform a depth‑first search that builds the code from left
to right.  At each step we try colours in ascending order and maintain for
every guess:

* `b` – black matches obtained so far;
* `m` – total colour matches (black + white) obtained so far.

When adding a colour we update these counters and prune the branch when any
constraint cannot be met:

* `b` or `m` exceeds the hint (`B` or `B+W`);
* even if the remaining positions were perfectly matched we could not reach the
  required `B` or `B+W`.

If all positions are filled we accept the candidate when all counters exactly
match the hints.  The first solution returned by the search is the
lexicographically smallest.

The complexity is manageable because the branching factor is limited by the
hints and `P` is at most 10.
