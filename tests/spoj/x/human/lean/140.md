# [The Loner](https://www.spoj.com/problems/LONER)

Given a one-dimensional board where `1` marks a pawn and `0` an empty
square, a move jumps a pawn over an adjacent pawn into an empty square two
cells away.  The jumped pawn is removed.  The goal is to determine whether a
given starting position can be reduced to exactly one pawn.

## Algorithm

The solver explores the game state space using depthâ€“first search with
memoisation.

- Count the pawns.  If exactly one remains the position is winning; if no
  legal moves exist the search fails.
- For every occurrence of `110` or `011`, replace it respectively with
  `001` or `100` and recursively solve the resulting board.
- Use a hash set to avoid revisiting previously analysed positions.
- If any recursive call can reach a single pawn, the initial position is
  winnable.

The recursion explores all distinct configurations reachable through legal
moves.  For the sample inputs the explored search space is tiny, so the
method is sufficient.
