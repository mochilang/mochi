# ZOO - Zoo

Each child stands outside the circular zoo and observes five consecutive
enclosures.  A child is happy if at least one feared animal is removed or if at
least one loved animal remains.  They are unhappy only when *all* loved animals
are removed **and** none of the feared animals disappear.

Represent each enclosure by a bit: `1` if its animal is removed, `0` otherwise.
A child watching enclosures `E..E+4` corresponds to a clause on the five bits:
`(removed of any fear) OR (kept of any love)`.  There are only `2^5` possible
states for a window, so we can apply dynamic programming around the circle.

Process enclosures in order while keeping the removal state of the last four
positions.  For each starting pattern of enclosures `1..4` (16 possibilities) we
iterate through all `N` positions.  When considering position `i` we try both
choices for enclosure `i+4`, evaluate all children starting at `i` against the
resulting 5‑bit window and accumulate the number of happy children.  The next
state keeps the last four decisions.

After processing all enclosures the final four bits must match the initial
pattern to maintain circular consistency.  The maximum over all initial patterns
is the solution.  The algorithm runs in `O(N * 16 * 2)` transitions plus a small
factor to evaluate the children for each window, well within the limits for
`N ≤ 10^4` and `C ≤ 5·10^4`.
