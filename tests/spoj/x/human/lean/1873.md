# SPOJ ACARGO - Accumulate Cargo

[Problem Link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/ACARGO/)

The boxes sit on a circular belt of length `L` at distinct integer
positions. Moving a single box across a distance of `d` costs `d`, so we
wish to relocate the boxes so that they occupy `N` consecutive positions
modulo `L` with minimum total movement.

After sorting the positions we duplicate the array with an added `L` to
handle wrap‑around. For a window of `N` consecutive elements
`p[s], …, p[s+N-1]` (in the extended array) we want to shift them to
`base + i` for `i = 0 … N-1`. Setting `b[i] = p[i] - i`, the optimal
`base` for this window is the median of the `b` values. The cost equals
the sum of absolute deviations from the median.

Because the `b` array is nondecreasing, prefix sums let us evaluate the
cost of each sliding window in `O(1)` time. We take the minimum over all
`N` windows, yielding the answer.

The overall complexity is `O(N log N)` due to sorting, with `O(N)`
additional work for the window scan.
