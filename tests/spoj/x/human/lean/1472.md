# TOMJERRY - Tom and Jerry

This placeholder file corresponds to the SPOJ problem [Tom and Jerry](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TOMJERRY/).

The actual solution requires computing the expected time for Jerry to reach Tom in a graph while Tom performs a random walk. Implementing the full probabilistic model is non-trivial and has been left as a TODO.
