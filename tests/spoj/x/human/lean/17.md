## Problem Summary
Given an integer `r` such that `r = s^2 mod 4000000007`, where `s` is the number of seconds since `1970-01-01 00:00:00` GMT and `s` lies between the years 1970 and 2030, recover `s` and output the corresponding GMT time in `ctime` format.

## Algorithm
1. The modulus `p = 4000000007` is prime and `p â‰¡ 3 (mod 4)`. For such primes, a square root of `r` modulo `p` is given by `r^{(p+1)/4} mod p`.
2. The two modular roots are `x` and `p - x`. Since the actual timestamp is below `p/2`, choose the smaller of the two.
3. Convert `s` seconds to a calendar date:
   - Determine the total days, hour, minute, and second within the day.
   - Iterate from year 1970 subtracting days per year (accounting for leap years) to find the year and day-of-year.
   - Iterate over months to find month and day, handling leap years for February.
   - Compute the weekday as `(total_days + 4) mod 7` because 1970-01-01 was a Thursday.
   - Format the result as `Day Mon dd hh:mm:ss yyyy`, using a leading space for single-digit days and zero padding for time fields.

The modular exponentiation runs in `O(log p)` time, and the date conversion loops through at most 60 years and 12 months, keeping the algorithm fast and using constant memory.
