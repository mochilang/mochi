## Problem Summary
Convert a number from one base (2–16) to another base (2–16). Each input line provides the number, the source base, and the target base. The calculator's display is 7 characters wide. Print the converted number right‑justified in this width, or print `ERROR` right‑justified if the result exceeds seven characters. Digits use 0‑9 and uppercase A‑F.

## Algorithm
1. Read each line and split it into the number string `s`, the source base `b1`, and the target base `b2`.
2. Convert `s` to a decimal value:
   - Initialize `value = 0`.
   - For each digit `c` in `s`, set `value = value * b1 + digit(c)` where `digit(c)` maps `'0'..'9'` and `'A'..'F'` to 0–15.
3. Convert `value` to base `b2` by repeated division:
   - If `value` is 0, the representation is `"0"`.
   - Otherwise, repeatedly take `value % b2` to obtain digits and build the result string from least significant to most significant.
4. If the resulting string has more than 7 characters, output `ERROR`; otherwise, output the string.
5. Right‑justify the chosen output in a field of width 7 and print it.

This algorithm runs in O(L) time per number, where L is the length of the input representation, and uses constant extra memory aside from the output string.
