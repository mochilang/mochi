## Problem Summary
Convert a decimal integer `n` (`-2 \times 10^9 \le n \le 2 \times 10^9`) to its representation in base `-2` using only digits `0` and `1`. The value `0` must be printed as a single digit `0`.

## Algorithm
1. If `n = 0`, output `"0"`.
2. Otherwise repeat:
   - Let `r = n mod 2`, which is always `0` or `1` even for negative `n`.
   - Prepend digit `r` to the result.
   - Set `n = (n - r) / (-2)`.
   - Continue until `n = 0`.
3. Concatenate the collected digits to form the negabinary representation.

Each iteration divides the magnitude of `n` by roughly two, so the loop finishes after `O(log |n|)` steps.

## Correctness
- `r = n mod 2` gives the least significant digit of `n` in base `-2`.
- After subtracting `r`, `n - r` is divisible by `-2`; dividing by `-2` shifts the representation one digit to the left without changing the remaining higher-order digits.
- Repeating until `n = 0` therefore yields all digits from least to most significant, producing a correct base `-2` representation.
- When the input is `0`, the algorithm outputs `"0"` as required.

## Complexity
The loop runs `O(log |n|)` iterations with constant work each, so the time and space complexity are `O(log |n|)`.
