# [Square Root](https://www.spoj.com/problems/SQRROOT)

## Problem Summary
For each test case we are given a decimal representation of a perfect square (up to 800 digits). We must output its integer square root.

## Algorithm
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case read the next line as a string and convert it to a natural number using a decimal fold.
3. Use `Nat.sqrt` to compute the integer square root. Lean's `Nat` type uses arbitrary-precision integers, so numbers with hundreds of digits are supported directly.
4. Print each result on its own line.

The complexity of `Nat.sqrt` is roughly logarithmic in the value of the input number, so the procedure is efficient even for 800-digit values.
