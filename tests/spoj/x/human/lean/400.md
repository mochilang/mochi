## Problem Summary
Mo writes the plaintext down the columns of a matrix with a fixed number of columns and pads to form a rectangle. He then sends the ciphertext by reading rows in a zigzag manner, alternating left-to-right and right-to-left. Given the column count and the ciphertext, reconstruct the original message (including padding letters) for each test case.

## Algorithm
1. Let `c` be the number of columns and `s` the ciphertext of length `n`; compute `rows = n / c`.
2. Recreate the matrix by taking successive blocks of `c` characters from `s`. Reverse every odd-numbered row to undo the zigzag ordering.
3. Read the matrix column by column from top to bottom, appending characters to build the decoded message.
4. Repeat until a column count of `0` is encountered.

This algorithm touches each character a constant number of times, so it runs in `O(n)` time with `O(n)` extra space.
