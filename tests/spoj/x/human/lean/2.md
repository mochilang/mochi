## Problem Summary
For each test case, given integers \(m\) and \(n\), output all prime numbers in the inclusive range \([m,n]\). Test cases are separated by a blank line.

## Algorithm
1. For each integer \(k\) in \([m,n]\), determine whether \(k\) is prime.
2. A number \(k\) is prime if it is greater than 1 and no integer from 2 to \(\lfloor\sqrt{k}\rfloor\) divides it.
3. Print each prime found; after each test case except the last, output a blank line.

This trial division approach is simple and uses constant additional memory.
