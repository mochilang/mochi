# SPOJ 1697 - Ohgas' Fortune

We are given several operations each defined by:

* type: simple (`0`) or compound (`1`) interest
* interest rate `r`, given as a multiple of `1/8192`
* annual operation charge `c`

Starting with an initial fund `F` and operating for `Y` years we must choose the
operation that yields the maximum final amount.  For each year the following
is performed:

```
interest = floor(balance * r)
if compound: balance += interest
balance -= c
if simple: accumulate interest separately
```

The final amount is `balance` for compound interest or `balance + accumulated`
for simple interest.

Because the rate is a multiple of `1/8192` we store it as an integer
`rateUnits = r * 8192` and compute `interest = balance * rateUnits / 8192`
using integer arithmetic, guaranteeing exact rounding and avoiding floating
point errors.

We iterate over all operations, simulate the `Y` years, and keep the maximum
final amount.

The constraints are tiny (≤100 operations and ≤10 years), so the algorithm is
`O(n·Y)` per dataset which is easily fast enough.
