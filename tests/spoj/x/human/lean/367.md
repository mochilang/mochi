# [Empodia](https://www.spoj.com/problems/EMPODIA/)

A biosequence is a permutation of the numbers `0..M-1` that starts with `0`, ends
with `M-1` and does not contain adjacent `E,E+1`.  A segment of consecutive
positions is a *framed interval* when

* the first element is the smallest element of the segment,
* the last element is the largest element, and
* all values between the first and last occur inside the segment.

A framed interval with no shorter framed interval inside it is an *empodio*.

For each test case we scan all possible segments of the sequence.  For a
candidate segment `[l,r]` we maintain the current minimum and maximum while we
extend `r`.  The segment is a framed interval when `min = a[l]`,
`max = a[r]` and `max - min = r - l`.  If the segment is a framed interval we
check all of its proper subsegments and ensure none of them is framed; otherwise
the segment is an empodio and we record its (1-based) bounds.

The procedure is `O(n^3)` in the worst case but the constraints of the example
input are small, so the simple approach suffices for the golden tests.
