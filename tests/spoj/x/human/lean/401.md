## Problem Summary
Given two alphabetical lists of the same two-word phrases, one in each of two languages, the original pairing between phrases has been lost. Each phrase corresponds word-for-word, and there are at most 25 distinct words in total. For each word in the first language, determine its unique translation in the second language.

## Algorithm
1. Read `n` followed by `n` phrases of language 1 and `n` phrases of language 2.
2. Map every distinct word in each language to an index and count how many times each ordered pair of words (firstâ†’second) occurs.
3. Compute, for each word, its out-degree (times it appears first) and in-degree (times it appears second).
4. For every word in language 1, build the list of candidate translations in language 2 with matching in- and out-degrees.
5. Use backtracking to assign translations: pick an unassigned word with the fewest candidates, try each candidate not yet used, and ensure all known phrase counts between already mapped words match in both languages. The constraints guarantee a unique solution.
6. After finding the bijection, output each word from language 1 with its translation, sorted alphabetically by the first-language word.
