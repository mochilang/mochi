# [Run Length Encoding](https://www.spoj.com/problems/ENCONDIN/)

## Problem Summary
Given lines of text containing letters, digits, spaces and punctuation, encode each line using a variant of run-length encoding:
- Runs of 2–9 identical characters become two characters: the digit for the run length followed by the character.
- Longer runs are split into chunks of at most nine characters each.
- Sequences without repeated adjacent characters are wrapped by `1` and another `1`, escaping any `1` inside by doubling it.
The trailing newline of each input line is passed through unchanged.

## Algorithm
1. Process each line independently.
2. Scan the line left to right, grouping consecutive identical characters.
3. When a run with length ≥ 2 is found, first flush any pending literal segment by outputting `1` + segment (with `1` escaped) + `1`, then emit the run in chunks of at most nine characters as `<len><char>`.
4. Characters that do not repeat are accumulated in a literal buffer.
5. After scanning the line, flush the remaining literal buffer using the same wrapping.

This produces the encoded representation for the line, which is printed followed by a newline.
