# [Making Labels](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MKLABELS/)

## Problem Summary
Given an integer \(N\) (1 \le N \le 10\), compute how many different labeled trees exist on \(N\) vertices. For each case,
print `Case i, N = N, # of different labelings = X` where \(X\) is the count and `i` is the 1â€‘based test case index.
Input terminates with a single 0.

## Algorithm
1. For each input \(N > 0\), use Cayley's formula which states that the number of labeled trees on \(N\) vertices is \(N^{N-2}\).
2. Compute \(N^{N-2}\) using integer exponentiation.
3. Output the formatted line with the case number and result.

Since \(N \le 10\), the computation is trivial and runs in constant time per case.
