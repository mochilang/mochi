# COCONUTS - Coconuts

We have `n` guards, each holding an initial belief (0 or 1).  Every pair of friends incurs a
penalty of 1 if their votes differ, and each guard pays a penalty of 1 for voting against his own
belief.  We must choose votes minimizing the total penalty.

This is a standard binary labeling problem that can be solved via an s-t minimum cut:

* Create a graph with one vertex for each guard and add a source `s` and sink `t`.
* For guard `i` with belief 1, connect `s → i` with capacity 1; for belief 0, connect
  `i → t` with capacity 1.  Cutting these edges pays the cost of voting against the belief.
* For every pair of friends `(i, j)`, connect `i` and `j` with capacity 1 in both directions.
  Cutting one of these edges corresponds to friends voting differently and costs 1.

The minimum s-t cut of this network equals the desired minimal penalty.  We compute it using the
Edmonds–Karp (BFS-based augmenting path) algorithm on an adjacency matrix of size `(n+2) × (n+2)`.
The constraints `n ≤ 300` and `m ≤ n(n-1)/2` keep the network small enough for this approach.
