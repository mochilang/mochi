## Problem Summary
Given a grid up to 25×25 describing a shop layout, find the minimum time to
walk from the starting square `S` to destination `D`. Impassable shelves are
marked `X`. Traversable squares contain digits `1`–`9` representing the time
to enter that square. Movement is allowed only horizontally or vertically and
input may contain multiple test cases terminated by `0 0`.

## Algorithm
1. Parse each test case and build a matrix of optional costs. Mark the starting
   and destination coordinates.
2. Run Dijkstra's algorithm on the grid: repeatedly pick the unvisited cell
   with the lowest accumulated cost and relax its four neighbours. Each move
   adds the digit value of the destination cell to the path cost.
3. The process continues until all nodes are processed; the distance stored for
   the destination cell is the minimal time.

The grid has at most 625 cells, so a simple `O(V²)` implementation of Dijkstra
(using arrays instead of a heap) is sufficient.
