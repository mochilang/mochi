# KPPOLY - Projections Of A Polygon

Given a convex polygon we may rotate it arbitrarily. For a fixed rotation the sum of the lengths of the projections on the x and y axes is simply the perimeter of the axis-aligned bounding box: if we rotate by angle `θ`, the width is `max_i(x_i cos θ + y_i sin θ) - min_i(x_i cos θ + y_i sin θ)` and the height is `max_i(-x_i sin θ + y_i cos θ) - min_i(-x_i sin θ + y_i cos θ)`.

The function `f(θ) = width(θ) + height(θ)` is periodic with period `π/2`. Its slope only changes when some pair of vertices becomes extreme along one of the two orthogonal directions, which means that all potential extrema of `f` occur when the x-axis of the rotated system is parallel to a line through a pair of vertices of the polygon.

Therefore, to find the minimum and maximum we iterate over all `O(n^2)` pairs of vertices, compute the angle of the line through the pair (normalized to `[0, π/2)`), and evaluate `f(θ)` at this angle. For each angle we project all vertices onto the rotated axes to obtain the width and height and update the global minimum and maximum.

This yields an `O(n^3)` algorithm with `n ≤ 100`, fast enough for the problem constraints, and provides answers accurate to the required tolerance.
