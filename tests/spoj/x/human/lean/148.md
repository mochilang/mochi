# MLAND - Land for Motorways

We have `n` cities and `m` potential bidirectional roads.  The price of road `i`
changes linearly with time `t` as `b_i + a_i * t`.  For any moment in the range
`[t1, t2]` we would pick the minimum spanning tree and pay the sum of its edge
prices.  The commission we earn is proportional to this total cost, so we need
to choose the time when the MST cost is maximised.

The cost of a fixed spanning tree is a linear function of `t`, therefore the
MST cost is the minimum over many linear functions â€“ a concave, piecewise linear
function.  Its derivative is the sum of slopes `a_i` of the edges that belong to
the MST at that time.  This derivative is non-increasing and we only need the
first moment when it becomes non-positive.

Algorithm:

1.  Given a time `t`, compute the MST by Kruskal's algorithm.  While selecting
    edges we accumulate the total cost and the sum of their slopes.  The latter
    is the derivative of the MST cost at time `t`.
2.  Evaluate the derivative at the endpoints `t1` and `t2`.  If the derivative
    at `t1` is already non-positive the best moment is `t1`; if the derivative at
    `t2` is still positive the best moment is `t2`.
3.  Otherwise binary search on `[t1,t2]` for the earliest `t` where the
    derivative becomes non-positive.  The function is concave, so this `t` gives
    the maximal cost.
4.  Output the chosen time and the corresponding MST cost, formatted to three
    decimal places.

The search uses around 80 iterations which is plenty for double precision, and
Kruskal's algorithm runs in `O(m log m)` for each evaluation.
