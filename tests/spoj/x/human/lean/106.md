# [Binary Stirling Numbers](https://www.spoj.com/problems/BINSTIRL)

## Problem Summary
For each query of integers `n` and `m` (`1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 10^9`) compute the parity of the Stirling number of the second kind `S(n,m)`; output `1` if it is odd and `0` otherwise.

## Algorithm
The parity of `S(n,m)` follows a simple bit criterion:
`S(n,m)` is odd iff `((n - m) & ((m - 1) >> 1)) = 0`.
This arises from examining the recurrence modulo 2 and the binary representation of `n` and `m`.

1. Read the number of test cases `d`.
2. For each pair `(n,m)`:
   - Compute `mask = (m - 1) >> 1`.
   - If `(n - m) & mask` equals `0`, print `1`; otherwise print `0`.

Each query runs in constant time and uses only basic bit operations.
