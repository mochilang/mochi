# [Cylinder](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CYLINDER/)

Cut the sheet horizontally so that a circle of radius `r` (base) fits in the
upper part (requiring height `2r`). The remaining rectangle `w × (h-2r)` forms
the cylinder's side. Two orientations are possible:

- Use width `w` for the perimeter and height `h-2r`.
  Volume `V = π r² (h-2r)` with feasible `r ≤ min(h/3, w/(2π))`.
- Use `h-2r` for the perimeter and height `w`.
  Volume `V = π r² w` with `r ≤ min(w/2, h/(2(π+1)))`.

Evaluate both cases at their optimal `r` and output the larger volume,
rounded to three decimals.
