Given several words, determine if they can be arranged so that each word starts with the last letter of the previous word. All words must be used exactly once.

## Algorithm
1. Build a directed graph on the 26 lowercase letters. For each word add an edge from its first letter to its last letter.
2. Track in-degrees and out-degrees of each letter and mark which letters appear.
3. Use a union-find structure (treating edges as undirected) to ensure that all used letters belong to a single connected component.
4. The ordering is possible when the graph has an Euler path:
   - All letters have equal in- and out-degree (Euler circuit), or
   - Exactly one letter has out-degree one greater than its in-degree and exactly one letter has in-degree one greater than its out-degree (Euler trail).
5. If both the connectivity and degree conditions hold, output `Ordering is possible.`; otherwise output `The door cannot be opened.`

This runs in linear time in the number of words.
