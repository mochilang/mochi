# Hash it!

[Problem](https://www.spoj.com/problems/HASHIT/)

## Algorithm

We maintain a hash table of 101 slots. For a key `a₁a₂…aₙ` we compute

```
h = 19 * Σ ASCII(aᵢ) * (i)
index = h mod 101
```

When inserting a key we probe up to twenty positions:
`(index + j*j + 23*j) mod 101` for `j = 0…19`. If the key already
exists we do nothing. Otherwise we place it into the first empty slot
encountered.

Deletion searches through the same probe sequence and marks the slot as
empty if the key is found.

After processing all operations we output the number of stored keys and
all `index:key` pairs ordered by index.

The probing is limited to at most twenty locations, so every operation
runs in constant time.
