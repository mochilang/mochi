# [RECTNG1](https://www.spoj.com/problems/RECTNG1/)

Given `n` axis-aligned rectangles with integer coordinates, we need the number of
disconnected groups ("blocks") formed when rectangles are connected if they
share a common segment.  Two rectangles are adjacent when they overlap with
positive area or when they touch along an edge of positive length; touching only
at a point does not connect them.

## Algorithm

1. Read all rectangles for the test case.
2. For every pair of rectangles check if they intersect or share a boundary
   segment.  Two rectangles `A` and `B` are connected when:
   - `min(A.x2, B.x2) > max(A.x1, B.x1)` and
     `min(A.y2, B.y2) > max(A.y1, B.y1)` (positive area overlap), or
   - horizontal overlap is positive and one rectangle's top equals the other's
     bottom, or
   - vertical overlap is positive and one rectangle's right equals the other's
     left.
3. Use a union–find (disjoint-set) structure to merge all connected rectangles.
4. After processing all pairs, count the number of distinct set representatives;
   this is the number of separate blocks.

The number of rectangles is at most 7000, so an `O(n²)` pairwise check with
path-compressed union–find is sufficient.
