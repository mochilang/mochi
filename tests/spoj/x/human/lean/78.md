# MARBLES - Marbles

Hänschen chooses `n` marbles out of `k` colours with the constraint that
at least one marble of each colour is taken. Equal colours are
indistinguishable and order does not matter. We need the number of
combinations for each test case.

## Algorithm

The task is equivalent to counting the number of integer solutions of

```
x1 + x2 + … + xk = n,  xi ≥ 1
```

Using the "stars and bars" theorem, this number is the binomial
coefficient

```
C(n-1, k-1)
```

For each pair `(n, k)` we compute `C(n-1, k-1)` iteratively:

1. Set `k := min(k, n - k)` to reduce the number of iterations.
2. Start with `res = 1` and for `i` from `1` to `k` update
   `res = res * (n - k + i) / i`.
3. Output `res` for the test case.

The intermediate products are always divisible by `i`, so integer
division is safe and fits into a signed 64‑bit integer as promised by the
problem.

## Complexity

For each test case the loop runs `k` times where `k ≤ n`, giving
`O(k)` time and `O(1)` extra space.
