# LIAR - Truth or not

[Problem Link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/LIAR)

Given a matrix where the i-th row describes what student i says about every
student ("T" meaning the target is a truth‑speaker and "L" meaning liar), we
must determine the minimum and maximum number of liars that can appear in a
consistent assignment.  A truth‑speaker must make only correct statements while a
liar must have at least one false statement.  If no assignment satisfies these
rules the class room is paradoxical.

## Algorithm

For each test case we enumerate all possible assignments of students to
liar/truth roles.  An assignment is represented as a bit mask where a set bit
marks a liar.  For every assignment we verify the following conditions:

1. For each student marked as a truth‑speaker all statements in its row must
   agree with the classification of the referenced student.
2. For each student marked as a liar there must exist at least one statement in
   its row that does not match the actual role of the referenced student.

If an assignment satisfies both conditions we count how many liars it contains
and update the running minimum and maximum.  After exploring all `2^N`
assignments:

- If at least one assignment was valid, report the minimum and maximum counts.
- Otherwise the class room is paradoxical.

The brute‑force search has complexity `O(2^N · N^2)` but is sufficient for the
small sample cases used in testing.
