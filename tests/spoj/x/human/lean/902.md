# HANGOVER

We are given a target overhang `c` in card lengths.  A stack of `n` cards can
overhang the table by

```
1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/(n+1)
```

card lengths.  For each input `c` we need the minimal `n` such that this sum is
at least `c`.

Since `c \le 5.20`, the required number of cards is at most a few hundred.  The
solution repeatedly accumulates terms of the harmonic series until the running
sum reaches the target:

1. Start with `sum = 0` and `k = 0` cards.
2. While `sum < c`, add `1/(k+2)` to the sum and increment `k`.
3. When the loop finishes, `k` is the minimal number of cards.

Input consists of several lines each with a floating-point value.  The sentinel
`0.00` terminates the input.  For every `c` we output the number of cards in the
format `"n card(s)"`.
