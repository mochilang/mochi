## Problem Summary
Given the number `n` of positive integers that cannot be expressed as `a*p + b*q` for non-negative `a` and `b` and distinct primes `p` and `q`, output Euler's totient of `p*q`.

## Algorithm
For coprime `p` and `q` the count of non-representable integers is `(p-1)(q-1)/2`. Distinct primes are coprime, so `u = 2 * n`.

1. Read `n` as a big integer.
2. Multiply by two to obtain `u`.
3. Output `u`.

This approach uses only basic arithmetic and works for `n` up to 99 digits.
