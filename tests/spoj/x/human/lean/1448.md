# 3D Cover (COVER2)

We are given up to 100 axis-aligned cubes.  Each cube is specified by the
coordinates of its center `(x, y, z)` and the distance `r` from the center to any
face (half of the side length).  For each test case we must compute the volume of
the union of all cubes.

## Algorithm

All cube boundaries occur at coordinates `x ± r`, `y ± r`, `z ± r`.  If we sort and
remove duplicates from all x and y boundaries we obtain at most `2n` distinct
positions per axis.  Between two consecutive coordinates every cube is either
completely present or absent, so a cell formed by an x-interval and a y-interval
has constant coverage.

For each x interval and each y interval:

1. Gather the `z` ranges of all cubes that fully cover this x–y cell.
2. Sort these z-intervals and merge them to obtain the total covered length along
the z-axis.
3. Add `dx * dy * z_len` to the answer, where `dx` and `dy` are the widths of the
current x and y intervals.

This effectively performs coordinate compression on x and y and sweeps through
the grid while merging intervals along z.

## Complexity

Let `k = 2n` be the number of distinct coordinates on an axis.  We examine
`(k-1)^2` cells, and for each cell we scan the `n` cubes and merge their z
intervals.  With `n ≤ 100`, this is well within the limits.  The overall
complexity is `O(k^2 * n log n)` due to sorting the z-intervals for each cell.
