# RSORTING - Ranklist Sorting

Given a list of distinct player scores we must order them in decreasing order.
The only allowed operation moves the player at position `i` to position `j`
with cost `i + j`.

To minimize the total cost we keep as many players as possible in their
relative order and move each remaining player exactly once.

1. Sort the scores in decreasing order and assign each score its rank.
2. Replace the original list by these ranks.
3. Compute a longest increasing subsequence of the rank sequence.  Players in
   this subsequence already appear in correct relative order and need not move.
4. Collect the remaining ranks, sort them by their final position, and for each
   rank `r`:
   - find its current index `i` in the list,
   - output the move `i+1 r`,
   - remove it and insert it at position `r` (1‑based).

This produces the ranklist with the minimal number of moves and thus minimal
sum of costs.  The algorithm runs in `O(n^2)` time, which is sufficient for
`n ≤ 1000`.
