# [Hit or Miss](https://www.spoj.com/problems/HITOMISS/)

## Problem Summary
Simulate the multi-player solitaire game "Hit or Miss." Each test case specifies the number of players and the 52-card deck held by the first player. Players count repeatedly from 1 to 13. On each cycle they:

1. Say their current count and check the top card.
2. If it matches, remove it and pass to the next player (the last player discards it).
3. If it does not match, move the card to the bottom of the deck.
4. Players without cards wait until a card is passed to them and resume their count from where they stopped.

The goal is to discard all cards. If a configuration repeats, the game is unwinnable.

## Algorithm
1. Represent each player as a record containing their deck, current count, and the last card they matched.
2. Maintain a hash set of seen states, where a state encodes every player's count and deck order.
3. Repeat:
   - If all decks are empty, output the last card discarded by each player.
   - If the current state has been seen before, the game is unwinnable.
   - Perform Step 1 for every player from first to last: process matches, move cards, increment counts, and remember any card to pass to the next player.
   - Perform Step 2 by appending the passed card (if any) to each player after the first.
4. Continue until the game is won or declared unwinnable.

This simulation uses O(number of transitions) time and stores visited states to guarantee termination.
