# VFMUL - Very Fast Multiplication

We are given `n` pairs of non-negative integers, each up to 300000 decimal digits.
For every pair we output the product.

To handle the huge numbers we parse each token manually, accumulating the value
by multiplying the current result by 10 and adding the next digit. Lean's
arbitrary-precision natural numbers store the values and perform the
multiplication. We iterate over all `n` pairs and print the results.
