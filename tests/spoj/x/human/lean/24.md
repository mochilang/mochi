# [Small factorials](https://www.spoj.com/problems/FCTRL2)

## Problem Summary
Given up to 100 queries, each containing an integer `n` with `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, output `n!` for every query.

## Algorithm
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, parse `n` from input.
3. Compute the factorial using simple recursion: `fact 0 = 1` and `fact (n+1) = (n+1) * fact n`.
4. Print the factorial value.

Lean's `Nat` type uses arbitrary precision, so it can represent factorials up to 100!. The algorithm runs in `O(t * n)` time with negligible memory usage.
