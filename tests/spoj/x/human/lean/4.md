# [Transform the Expression](https://www.spoj.com/problems/ONP/)

## Problem Summary
Convert algebraic expressions containing lowercase letters, operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`, and parentheses into Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).

## Algorithm
1. Read the number of expressions `t`.
2. For each expression:
   - Traverse characters one by one.
   - If the character is a letter, append it directly to the output.
   - If it is `(`, push it onto a stack.
   - If it is `)`, pop operators from the stack to the output until `(` is removed.
   - For an operator, pop from the stack all operators with higher precedence or with equal precedence when the operator is not right associative (`^`), then push the current operator.
   - After the traversal, pop any remaining operators from the stack to the output.
3. Print each resulting RPN expression on its own line.

This is the classic shunting-yard algorithm and runs in linear time using a stack proportional to the depth of nested parentheses.
