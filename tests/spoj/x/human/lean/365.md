## Problem Summary
Given a rectangular marble slab of width `W` and height `H`, and a list of allowed plate sizes `(Wi, Hi)` which cannot be rotated, cut the slab using only vertical or horizontal cuts to produce any number of those plates. Any remaining pieces are wasted. For each test case, find the minimum possible wasted area.

## Algorithm
1. Create a dynamic programming table `dp[w][h]` representing the maximum area of a `w × h` rectangle that can be completely filled with allowed plates.
2. Initialize `dp[Wi][Hi] = Wi * Hi` for every given plate size.
3. For each `w` from `1` to `W` and each `h` from `1` to `H`:
   - Try every vertical cut `x` (`1 ≤ x < w`) and update `dp[w][h]` with `dp[x][h] + dp[w-x][h]`.
   - Try every horizontal cut `y` (`1 ≤ y < h`) and update `dp[w][h]` with `dp[w][y] + dp[w][h-y]`.
4. The minimal waste is `W × H - dp[W][H]`.

This fills at most `600 × 600` states, each examining up to `600` cuts, which is feasible within the problem limits.
