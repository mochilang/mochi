## Problem Summary
Given a fully parenthesized propositional formula using operators `!`, `&`, `|`, `-->` and `<->`,
produce its complete truth table. Each line of the truth table must have the same length as the
original formula: digits `0` or `1` are written under each subformula at the position of the
variable or in the middle of the operator, and all other characters are spaces.

## Algorithm
1. **Parsing**: treat the input string as an array of characters and parse it recursively.
   - Variables are single lowercase letters and record their index in the string.
   - `(! P)` becomes a unary node located at the `!` character.
   - `(P op Q)` becomes a binary node located at the middle of the operator token.
2. **Variable collection**: traverse the tree to collect all distinct variables, sort them and use
   their order to enumerate assignments from `000…0` to `111…1` with the first variable changing
   slowest.
3. **Evaluation**: for each assignment evaluate the expression recursively. While evaluating store
   the boolean value computed at every node together with its output position.
4. **Rendering**: create an array of spaces with length equal to the input line and fill recorded
   positions with `0` or `1`. Output the original formula line followed by the rendered lines for
   all assignments and a blank line.

The parsing and evaluation are both linear in the length of the formula. Enumerating all assignments
requires `2^n` evaluations where `n` is the number of distinct variables.
