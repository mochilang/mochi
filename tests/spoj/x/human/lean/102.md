## Problem Summary
Given the polyline describing the top contour of a pipe and assuming the bottom contour is exactly one unit below it, determine the largest x-coordinate that light emitted from the vertical segment at the left end of the pipe can reach. The light travels in straight lines and stops when it hits the pipe walls.

## Algorithm
1. Read the upper points `up[i] = (xi, yi)` and build corresponding lower points `down[i] = (xi, yi - 1)`.
2. For every pair of indices `(i, j)` with `i â‰  j`, consider the line passing through `up[i]` and `down[j]`.
3. Check each vertical segment formed by `up[k]` and `down[k]`:
   - If the line intersects every segment, the light can traverse the whole pipe and the answer is `x_n`.
   - Otherwise, identify the first segment it misses. Compute the intersection of the line with both the upper and lower edges adjoining this segment and update the best `x` reached.
4. The maximum `x` over all tested lines is printed with two decimal places. If some line crosses all segments, `x_n` is printed instead.

This brute-force enumeration over `O(n^2)` candidate lines, with at most 200 bends, is efficient enough.
