# [Fool the Police](https://www.spoj.com/problems/FPOLICE)

## Problem Summary
We are given `N` police stations and a time limit `T`. Travelling from station `i` to station `j` takes `time[i][j]` units of time and incurs `risk[i][j]` risk. Starting at station 1, we need to reach station `N` within total time `T`. Among all valid paths, we must minimize total risk and, among paths with the same minimal risk, choose the one with the smallest travel time. If no path fits in time `T`, output `-1`.

## Algorithm
1. Use dynamic programming over time.
2. Let `dp[t][i]` be the minimal risk needed to reach station `i` in exactly `t` time units. Initialize `dp[0][1] = 0` and all other entries to infinity.
3. For each time `t` from `0` to `T` and each station `i`:
   - If `dp[t][i]` is finite, try every destination `j`.
   - Compute `nt = t + time[i][j]`. If `nt ≤ T`, update `dp[nt][j]` with the minimal risk `dp[t][i] + risk[i][j]`.
4. After filling the table, scan all `dp[t][N]` for `t ≤ T`. Select the smallest risk and the smallest time achieving that risk.
5. If no entry is finite, the destination cannot be reached within time `T`.

## Complexity
The DP table has `(T + 1) × N` entries, and each transition considers `N` destinations. Thus the time complexity is `O(T · N^2)` per test case, with `O(T · N)` memory.
