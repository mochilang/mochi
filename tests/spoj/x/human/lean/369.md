## Problem Summary
Given a sequence `a₁ … aₙ` with `0 ≤ aᵢ ≤ n` and total sum not exceeding `n`,
find integers `x₁ … xₙ` (possibly negative) minimizing `|x₁| + … + |xₙ|`
subject to
`xᵢ − xᵢ₊₁ + aᵢ₊₁ ∈ {0,1}` for `i = 1 … n−1` and
`xₙ − x₁ + a₁ ∈ {0,1}`.

## Algorithm
1. Let `S = Σ aᵢ` and compute prefix sums `p[i] = Σ_{j≤i} aⱼ`.
2. For every candidate median `m` in `0 … S`:
   - Run a dynamic program where `dp[k]` stores the minimal cost after
     processing some prefix and choosing `k` subtractions so far.
     For each element we update a new table by adding `|p[i] − k − m|` and
     either keeping `k` or increasing it to `k + 1`.
   - After the entire array, `dp[S]` contains the minimal cost for this median
     because exactly `S` subtractions must be used overall.
3. The answer is the smallest value of `dp[S]` across all medians.

The outer loop runs `S + 1` times and each DP step touches at most `n × S`
states, giving an overall complexity of `O(n · S²)` with `S ≤ n ≤ 1000`.
