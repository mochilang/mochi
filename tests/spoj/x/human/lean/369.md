## Problem Summary
Given a sequence `a₁ … aₙ` with `0 ≤ aᵢ ≤ n` and total sum not exceeding `n`,
find integers `x₁ … xₙ` (possibly negative) minimizing `|x₁| + … + |xₙ|`
subject to
`xᵢ − xᵢ₊₁ + aᵢ₊₁ ∈ {0,1}` for `i = 1 … n−1` and
`xₙ − x₁ + a₁ ∈ {0,1}`.

## Algorithm
1. Let `S = Σ aᵢ` and compute prefix sums `p[i] = Σ_{j≤i} aⱼ`.
2. For every candidate median `m` in `0 … S`:
   - Use dynamic programming where `dp[i][k]` is the minimal cost after
     processing the first `i` numbers and choosing `k` subtractions among the
     `i` differences.  The transition for each state adds
     `|p[i] − k − m|` and either keeps `k` or increases it by one.
   - After the entire array, the state with `k = S` represents a valid
     configuration because exactly `S` subtractions are chosen.
3. The minimal value over all medians is the answer.

The DP table has dimensions at most `n × S` (`S ≤ n ≤ 1000`), making the
solution feasible for the given constraints.
