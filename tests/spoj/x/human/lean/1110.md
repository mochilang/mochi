## Problem Summary
Given up to 10 puzzles of a 16×16 Sudoku. Each grid uses the letters `A` through `P` and dashes `-` for empty cells. Fill every grid so that each row, column and each 4×4 sub-square contains all sixteen letters exactly once.

## Algorithm
1. Convert characters to numbers `0..15` (`16` denotes empty). Maintain three arrays of 16-bit masks for rows, columns and 4×4 blocks.
2. Collect coordinates of all empty cells.  For a cell `(r,c)` the used letters are `rowMask[r] ∨ colMask[c] ∨ boxMask[b]` with `b = (r div 4) * 4 + c div 4`.  Available letters are the complement inside the 16-bit mask.
3. Recursively fill the grid using depth-first search with backtracking.  At each step pick the empty cell with the fewest candidate letters (minimum remaining value heuristic) and try each candidate while updating the masks.
4. When all cells are filled the board is complete and printed.

Using bit masks allows constant-time constraint checks.  The heuristic keeps the search space manageable, enabling the solver to handle the 16×16 grids quickly.
