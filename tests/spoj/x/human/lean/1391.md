# [Summing to a Square Prime](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CZ_PROB1)

## Problem Summary
For each test case with integers `n` and `k`, let `S_{P2}(n)` denote the `n`‑th prime that can be expressed as a sum of two squares. Output the number of integer partitions of `S_{P2}(n)` whose largest part is at most `k`.

## Algorithm
1. **Generate Square-Sum Primes:** Use a sieve up to 8000 and collect primes equal to `2` or congruent to `1 mod 4`. These form the sequence `S_{P2}`; its `n`‑th element is `S_{P2}(n)`.
2. **Partition Table:** Precompute `p(a,k)` for all `a ≤ 7993` and `k ≤ 3` using dynamic programming on integer partitions with bounded part size. Initialize `dp[0]=1` and for each `k` update `dp[a] += dp[a-k]` for `a ≥ k`.
3. **Answer Queries:** For each pair `(n, k)`, fetch `a = S_{P2}(n)` and output `p(a,k)` from the precomputed table.

The sieve runs in `O(limit log log limit)` and partition DP is `O(limit * kmax)` with `limit=7993`, providing fast responses for up to 500 queries.
