## Problem Summary
Given a set of `K` keys and an ordered alphabet of `L` letters with
frequencies `F1..FL`, assign consecutive letters to each key (preserving
order) to minimize the total typing cost.  Typing cost of a letter is its
frequency times its position on the key.  When multiple layouts share the same
minimal cost, prefer the one that assigns more letters to later keys
(last key first, then next-to-last, etc.).

## Algorithm
1. Precompute prefix sums of frequencies and of `frequency * index` to allow
   `O(1)` computation of the cost for any contiguous block of letters on a key.
2. Use dynamic programming where `dp[k][l]` stores the best layout for placing
the first `l` letters on the first `k` keys, keeping both the minimal cost and
the list of block sizes used.
3. To build `dp[k][l]`, try every split point `t` (0 ≤ `t` ≤ `l`) where the
   last key receives the letters `t+1 .. l`.  Choose the candidate with the
   lower cost, breaking ties by comparing block sizes from the end so that more
   letters on later keys are preferred.
4. Recover the optimal block sizes from `dp[K][L]` and print the letters
   assigned to each key sequentially.

This DP runs in `O(K * L^2)` time which is sufficient for the problem
constraints (`K, L ≤ 90`).
