# EN - Entrapment

We need the planet closest to planet 1 that lies on **every** directed path from 1 to n.
In graph theory this is the dominator that is nearest to the source.

Algorithm steps:

1. Build adjacency and predecessor lists for the directed graph.
2. Run a depth‑first search from node 1 to obtain the nodes in reverse postorder.
3. Use the Cooper–Harvey–Kennedy iterative algorithm to compute the immediate
   dominator of every vertex.  For each node `v` (except 1) the dominator is
   `intersection` of the dominators of its predecessors.
4. Starting from node `n`, follow the `idom` links upward until the parent is 1.
   That node is the planet closest to Kashyyyk that all routes to Alderaan must pass through.

This runs in roughly linear time `O(n + m)` and handles the input limits.
