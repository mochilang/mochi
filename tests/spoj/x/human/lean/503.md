# [Prime Intervals](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PRINT)

## Problem Summary
For each of up to 150 test cases, given integers `L` and `U` with `2 ≤ L < U ≤ 2,147,483,647` and `U - L ≤ 1,000,000`, print all prime numbers in the inclusive interval `[L, U]`.

## Algorithm
1. Precompute all primes up to `sqrt(2,147,483,647) ≈ 46,340` using the classical sieve of Eratosthenes.
2. For each query `[L, U]`, create a boolean array of length `U - L + 1`, initially marking all numbers as prime.
3. For every precomputed prime `p` with `p² ≤ U`, mark multiples of `p` within `[L, U]` as composite. Start from `max(p², ceil(L/p) * p)` and increment by `p`.
4. Special-case `L = 1` since 1 is not prime.
5. Output all numbers still marked as prime, in order, separating test cases with a blank line.

This segmented sieve runs in `O((U-L+1) log log U)` per test case with only `O(U-L+1)` extra memory, meeting the problem constraints.
