# A place for the brewery (BROW)

We have several cities on a circular highway. City `i` demands `z_i` tanks of beer and the
distance to the next city is `d_i`. The brewery must be located in one of the cities. The
transport cost equals demand multiplied by the shortest distance along the circle. We must
choose the city minimizing the total cost.

## Algorithm
1. Compute positions of the cities using prefix sums of distances and also the total
   length `L` of the highway.
2. Duplicate the positions and demands with every duplicated position shifted by `L`.
   This linearizes the circle and allows us to consider clockwise segments easily.
3. Build prefix sums of demands and of demand multiplied by position for the duplicated
   arrays.
4. For each city `i`, extend a pointer `r` clockwise while the distance from `i` to `r` is
   at most `L/2`. The cities `[i+1, r]` are served clockwise and contribute
   `sum z_j * (pos_j - pos_i)` to the cost. The remaining cities are served
   counterclockwise and contribute `sum z_j * (L + pos_i - pos_j)`.
5. Evaluate the cost for every `i` and keep the minimum.

The pointer `r` only increases, so each city is processed once.

## Complexity
- Time: `O(n)` per test case.
- Space: `O(n)`.
