# [SPOJ CODE - Code](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CODE/)

Given `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 6), we must output a digit sequence that contains every possible `n`‑digit string exactly once as a substring. The required length is `10^n + n - 1`.

This is precisely a base‑10 de Bruijn sequence of order `n`. We generate it using the classical recursive algorithm:

1. Maintain an array `a` of length `10*n` and a list for the output digits.
2. Function `db(t, p)` fills the sequence by repeating the previous pattern and exploring higher digits. When `t > n` and `n` is divisible by `p`, it appends the first `p` digits to the output (forming a Lyndon word).
3. After generating `10^n` digits, append the first `n-1` digits to close the cycle and obtain a linear sequence of length `10^n + n - 1`.

The algorithm runs in `O(10^n)` time, generating at most one million digits for `n = 6`, and uses `O(n)` additional memory.
