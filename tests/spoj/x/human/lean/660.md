# QUEST4 - Dungeon of Death

[Problem link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/QUEST4/)

Given coordinates of missing tiles on a 120×120 grid, we must cover all of them with the fewest 120×1 planks placed horizontally or vertically. Each plank covers an entire row or column.

## Algorithm

The problem is equivalent to selecting the smallest number of rows and columns that cover all marked cells. This is a minimum vertex cover in a bipartite graph where:

- Left part: rows 0…119
- Right part: columns 0…119
- Edge between row *r* and column *c* if tile *(r,c)* is missing

By Kőnig's theorem, the size of a minimum vertex cover equals the size of a maximum matching. We therefore compute a maximum bipartite matching using a DFS based augmenting-path algorithm (Kuhn's algorithm).

Steps for each test case:

1. Build adjacency lists for rows from the given coordinates.
2. Initialize column matches to `none`.
3. For each row, attempt to find an augmenting path using DFS, resetting the visited columns each time. If successful, increment the matching size.
4. The final matching size is the minimum number of planks needed.

## Complexity

Let `n` be the number of missing tiles (≤ 10010). The algorithm runs `DFS` at most 120 times, and each DFS explores at most `n` edges. Hence the complexity is `O(120 * n)` which is efficient for the given constraints.
