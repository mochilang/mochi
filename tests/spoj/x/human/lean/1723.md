## Problem Summary
Given a honeycomb cell number in Willi's spiral numbering system, output the corresponding coordinates (x, y) in Maja's axial grid. Input contains one number per line (each < 100000), and each produces one pair of coordinates.

## Algorithm
1. **Determine ring**: For n > 1 find the minimal r such that `1 + 3 r (r + 1) >= n`. This r is the hexagonal ring containing cell n.
2. **Locate starting cell**: Ring r begins at index `start = 3 (r-1) r + 2` at coordinates (0, r). Compute `offset = n - start` inside the ring.
3. **Traverse ring**: Move along the six directions
   `(-1,0)`, `(0,-1)`, `(1,-1)`, `(1,0)`, `(0,1)`, `(-1,1)`
   each repeated r times, consuming `offset` steps. The resulting position is the coordinate for n.

This uses only constant extra memory and runs in O(âˆšn) time per query due to the ring search.
