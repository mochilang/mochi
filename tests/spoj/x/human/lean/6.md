# ARITH - A Simple Calculator

Given two big integers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`), the task is to mimic
manual arithmetic formatting.

## Algorithm

1. **Parse** the input line to obtain `a`, `op`, `b`.
2. **Addition / Subtraction**
   - Compute the result using arbitrary precision integers.
   - Let `opb = op ++ b`.
   - Determine the output width as the maximum length among `a`, `opb` and the
     result.
   - Print `a` and `opb` right–aligned to the width.
   - Print a row of dashes whose length is `max(len(opb), len(result))`, padded
     to the width.
   - Print the result right–aligned to the width.
3. **Multiplication**
   - Multiply `a` by each digit of `b` starting from the last digit to obtain
     partial products.
   - Track the maximal width of any partial product after accounting for its
     shift.
   - The overall width is the maximum among `a`, `opb`, the final result and the
     widest partial product.
   - If `b` has one digit, output is similar to addition.
   - Otherwise:
     - Print the first dash line using `max(len(opb), len(first partial))`.
     - Print all partial products so that the last digit of each product aligns
       with the corresponding digit of `b`.
     - Print a second dash line using `max(len(result), widest partial)` and then
       the final result, all right–aligned to the overall width.
4. After each expression, print a blank line.

This reproduces the columnar layout of handwritten arithmetic.
