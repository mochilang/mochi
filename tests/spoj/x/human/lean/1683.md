# EXPRESS (SPOJ 1683) - Queue equivalent postfix

We are given a postfix expression where operands are lowercase letters and operators are uppercase letters. Normally such an expression is evaluated by a stack. The task is to rewrite it so that the same computation is obtained when the evaluation algorithm uses a **queue** instead of a stack.

## Algorithm

1. Parse the postfix expression into a binary tree.
   - Scan the characters from left to right.
   - For a lowercase letter push a leaf node onto a stack.
   - For an operator pop two nodes (right then left) and push a new internal node.
2. Perform a breadth-first traversal of this tree where we visit the left child before the right child. Record every visited node in a list.
3. Reverse the list and output the stored node values. This produces the required postfix expression that works with a queue.

The reason this works is that breadth-first order (with left first) lists nodes level by level from root to leaves. Reversing this order therefore lists all leaves in right-to-left order, followed by internal nodes from the deepest level up to the root. This is exactly the order needed so that, when using a queue for evaluation, every operator sees its right operand first and its left operand second.

## Complexity

Let *n* be the length of the expression. Both the tree construction and the traversal are linear, giving a total time complexity of `O(n)` and a memory usage of `O(n)`.
