# EMPTY - Empty Cuboids

We are given up to 5000 lattice points inside the cube `[1,10^6]^3`.  For every
test case we must find an axis-aligned cuboid with one vertex at the origin and
edge lengths `x, y, z ≤ 10^6` of maximum volume which does **not** contain any
given point strictly inside.

A point `(xi, yi, zi)` is inside the cuboid iff `xi < x`, `yi < y` and `zi < z`.
Thus for every point we must have `x ≤ xi` **or** `y ≤ yi` **or** `z ≤ zi`.  The
feasible region of `(x, y, z)` is therefore monotone: if a triple is valid then
any smaller triple is also valid.  The optimum must lie on the boundary defined
by some existing point.

## Algorithm

1.  Consider candidate values of `x`: all `xi` from the input and the upper
    limit `10^6`.  Sorting them guarantees that between two consecutive
    candidates the set of violating points does not change, therefore the volume
    is maximized at one of these candidates.
2.  Process the points in order of increasing `x`.  For a fixed `x` all points
    with smaller `x` restrict the choice of `y` and `z`.  Disregarding the fixed
    `x`, the 2‑D subproblem becomes: choose `y` and `z` to maximize `y*z` so that
    no point `(yi, zi)` satisfies `yi < y` and `zi < z`.
3.  For this 2‑D problem, sort the active points by `y`.  While scanning in
    increasing `y`, maintain the minimum `z` seen so far.  For each step the
    product `y * min_z` is a valid candidate; the final step also considers
    `y = 10^6`.  The best `(y, z)` pair and its product are returned.
4.  Combine the best `y*z` with the current `x` to obtain a volume.  Keep the
    triple with maximum volume over all candidates.

The complexity is `O(n^2 log n)` in the worst case (because for each of the
`n` candidates we sort up to `n` points by `y`), which is adequate for the test
suite and demonstrates the intended geometric reasoning.
