# [Empty Cuboids](https://www.spoj.com/problems/EMPTY/)

## Problem Summary
Given up to 5000 integer points \((x,y,z)\) with coordinates in \([1,10^6]\),
find the axis-aligned cuboid with one corner at the origin and edges parallel to
the axes (lengths at most \(10^6\)) that has maximum volume while containing
no given point strictly inside. Points on the boundary are allowed.

## Algorithm
We sweep possible edge lengths in decreasing order.

1. Sort all points by their `x` coordinate.
2. Maintain a list of pairs `(y,z)` for points whose `x` coordinate is smaller
   than the current candidate `x`. The list is kept sorted by `y` and only the
   smallest `z` for each `y` is stored.
3. For the current set of `(y,z)` points, compute the largest possible
   `y * z` area that avoids all points:
   - Scan the list by increasing `y`.
   - Before each `y`, consider choosing `y' = y - 1` and multiply it by the
     minimum `z` encountered so far.
   - Finally consider `y = 10^6` with the minimum `z` over all points.
4. Multiply the best `y * z` area by the current candidate `x` (the greatest
   value before the next point's `x`) and keep the best volume and coordinates.
5. Insert the current point's `(y,z)` into the sorted list and continue.
6. After all points, perform step 3 once more with `x = 10^6`.

The candidate coordinates are always either `10^6` or one less than some point's
coordinate, which ensures no point lies strictly inside.

## Complexity
Let `n` be the number of points. Each point is inserted once and the list is
scanned once for every distinct `x`, leading to an overall complexity of
`O(n^2)` time and `O(n)` memory, which is sufficient for `n â‰¤ 5000`.
