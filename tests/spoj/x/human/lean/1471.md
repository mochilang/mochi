## Problem Summary
We are given ten triangular boards, each consisting of rows of length
`1..10`.  The board contains 55 cells in total.  Twelve tile shapes
labelled `A`–`L` must be placed so that every cell is covered exactly once
and each piece is used exactly once.  A board may already contain some
letters indicating that part or all of a piece has been fixed in place.
The pieces may be rotated and flipped.

## Algorithm
1. Represent the board as a triangular grid of coordinates `(row, col)`
   where `0 ≤ col ≤ row < 10`.
2. For every piece build all unique orientations produced by the four
   rotations and horizontal reflection.  Each orientation is stored as a
   list of relative offsets.
3. From the initial board collect the coordinates already occupied by
   each letter.  If the count equals the size of its piece, it is marked
   as already placed.
4. Recursively place the remaining pieces:
   - choose the next unused piece,
   - try every orientation at every possible position,
   - a placement is valid when all covered cells are inside the triangle,
     currently empty (or already containing the same letter) and include
     all preset cells for that piece,
   - after placing a piece, recurse for the rest.
5. If all pieces are placed the filled board is printed; otherwise
   `No solution` is reported.

The search space is small because there are only twelve pieces, and the
prefilled cells greatly restrict the possibilities.  A simple depth-first
backtracking search suffices to find a tiling.
