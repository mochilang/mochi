## Problem Summary
For each bus route we are given the number of stops and the niceness of each road segment between consecutive stops. We must find the contiguous segment of roads with the maximum total niceness. If several segments have the same total, prefer the longest one; if there is still a tie, choose the earliest starting stop. If all segments have non‑positive total niceness, report that the route has no nice parts.

## Algorithm
We adapt Kadane's maximum subarray algorithm with additional tie‑breaking:
1. Traverse the niceness values keeping the current sum and its starting stop.
2. Whenever the current sum exceeds the best sum, or equals it with a longer length, update the best segment.
3. If the current sum becomes negative, reset it to zero and move the start to the next stop.
4. After processing all segments, output the stored best segment if its sum is positive; otherwise state that there are no nice parts.

This method processes each route in linear time Θ(s) using constant extra space.
