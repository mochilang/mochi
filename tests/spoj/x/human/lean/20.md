# SPOJ CRYPTO4 - The Bytelandian Cryptographer (Act IV)

We are given a partly damaged plaintext `x` and its Vigenère encrypted
version `y`.  The unknown key has length `n` with `1 ≤ n ≤ m`.  For
positions where both `x_i` and `y_i` are known we can derive the key
value used: `k_j = (y_i - x_i) mod 26` for `j = i mod n`.  A candidate
`n` is valid only if all such constraints agree.

For every `n` from `1` to `m` we:

1. Check consistency of the key values inferred from the known pairs.
2. If consistent, compute the letters of `x` whenever the corresponding
   key value and `y_i` are known.

The final reconstructed message keeps a letter only when *all* valid `n`
produce the same letter in that position; otherwise an asterisk `*` is
printed.

This direct enumeration works for the small constraints of the provided
test cases.
