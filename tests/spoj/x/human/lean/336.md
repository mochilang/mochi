# Solution for SPOJ EOPERA - Exchange Operations

The board contains numbers `0..11`.  The allowed swap operations always involve
`0` and are limited to certain distances:

* distance `1` within each block of three positions
* distance `3` within each block of six positions
* distance `6` within the entire sequence

These rules define a fixed graph on the 12 positions.  When `0` is at index `i`
it may move to any neighbor of `i` in this graph.

To obtain the minimum number of exchanges we perform a breadth‑first search
(BFS) on permutations.  States are encoded in base‑12 as a single integer so
that they can be stored in a hash set.  From the current permutation we locate
the position of `0`, generate all valid swaps, and push unseen states into the
queue.  The search stops once the sorted permutation `0..11` is dequeued.

The branching factor is at most four and the required depths are small (≤10),
so the BFS explores only a few thousand states and runs quickly.
