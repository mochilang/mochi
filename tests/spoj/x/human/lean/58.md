# [Crime at Piccadily Circus](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PICAD)

## Problem Summary
Given the earliest and latest possible times of a crime, and for each witness the times they arrived and left the scene,
find the minimum and maximum number of people present simultaneously at any moment within that interval.

## Algorithm
1. For each witness, intersect their interval `[a_i, b_i]` with the crime window `[p, k]`. If the intersection is empty, ignore it.
2. For each remaining interval `[s, e]`, add an event `+1` at `s` and an event `-1` at `e+1`.
3. Insert boundary events at `p` and `k+1` so the sweep covers the entire crime window.
4. Sort all event times and sweep through them, accumulating a running count of people present.
5. Track the minimum and maximum counts for times `â‰¤ k` during the sweep and output those values.

Sorting the events costs `O(n log n)` and the sweep is linear, handling up to 5000 witnesses efficiently.
