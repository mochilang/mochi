# Travelling tours (SPOJ TOURS)

We are given a directed graph with `N` places and `M` one–way streets.  Every place
has to belong to exactly one tour and every tour is a simple cycle of length at
least two.  We want the total length of all chosen streets to be minimal.

This is the classic **minimum weight cycle cover** problem on a directed graph.
A cycle cover corresponds to choosing exactly one outgoing edge and one incoming
edge for every vertex.  This is equivalent to the assignment problem on a
complete bipartite graph.  We can solve it with the Hungarian algorithm.

## Algorithm

1. Build an `N × N` cost matrix.  For every street `u → v` with length `w`
   (ignoring self‑loops) store the minimal weight in the matrix.
   Missing edges are given an infinite cost.
2. Run the Hungarian algorithm on this matrix to obtain the minimum weight
   perfect matching, which corresponds to a minimum cycle cover of the graph.
3. Output the sum of the selected edge weights.

The Hungarian algorithm runs in `O(N^3)` time, which is fast enough for
`N ≤ 200`.
