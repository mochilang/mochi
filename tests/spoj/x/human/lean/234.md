# HOLIDAY1 - Getting Rid of the Holidays (Act I)

We must delete `k` of the `n` periodic holidays so that the time between
consecutive holiday parties is as large as possible.  For a set of remaining
holidays the minimum distance between party days is equal to the minimum of the
pairwise gcd of their periods.  Thus, when we keep a subset `S` the quantity to
maximize is `min_{i<j in S} gcd(t_i,t_j)`.

## Algorithm

1. For every pair of periods compute `gcd(t_i,t_j)` and collect all these values
   together with the original periods.  The answer must be one of these numbers,
   so we examine them in decreasing order.
2. For a candidate value `g` build a graph where vertices are holidays and there
   is an edge between two holidays iff their gcd is at least `g`.
3. Check whether this graph contains a clique of size `n-k` using a simple
   backtracking search.  The search keeps a current clique and a list of
   candidates which are adjacent to all vertices already in the clique.  If we
   can build a clique of the required size we are done.
4. The first `g` that admits such a clique is optimal.  The holidays not
   included in the found clique are the ones to remove.

This approach works because candidate gcd values are few (≤ 465 for `n ≤ 30`) and
searching for a clique among at most 30 nodes is fast.
