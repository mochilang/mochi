# [Roots of polynomial](https://www.spoj.com/problems/KMSL4B/)

Given a polynomial \(p(x) = p_0 + p_1 x + \cdots + p_k x^k\) with \(k \le 20\), determine whether all its roots lie inside the open unit disc \(|z| < 1\) on the complex plane.

## Algorithm

We apply the Schur–Cohn criterion which recursively checks stability of a polynomial inside the unit circle.

1. Let the coefficient array be \(a_0,\ldots,a_n\) where \(a_0\) is the constant term and \(a_n\) the leading coefficient.
2. While the degree \(n>0\):
   * If \(|a_0| \ge |a_n|\), the polynomial has a root on or outside the unit circle → answer `0`.
   * Otherwise form a new polynomial of degree \(n-1\) with coefficients
     \[b_i = a_n a_{i+1} - a_0 a_{n-1-i},\qquad 0 \le i < n.\]
     Replace the current coefficient array with the \(b_i\) values and repeat.
3. If the loop finishes reducing the degree to zero, all roots lie strictly inside the unit disc → answer `1`.

This process requires only \(O(n^2)\) operations and works well for the given constraint \(n \le 20\).
