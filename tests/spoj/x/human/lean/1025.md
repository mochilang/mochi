[Problem](https://www.spoj.com/problems/FASHION/)

Given hotness ratings of N men and N women, pair them to maximize total hotness bond where bond of a pair is x*y. By the rearrangement inequality, sorting both arrays in the same order (e.g. ascending) and pairing elements at corresponding positions yields the maximum sum. After sorting, multiply each pair and accumulate the total.

The algorithm sorts both lists (O(N log N)) and sums the products of corresponding elements (O(N)).
