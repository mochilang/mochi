# [Ws Cipher](https://www.spoj.com/problems/WSCIPHER)

## Problem Summary
We are given multiple encrypted lowercase strings. Each test case supplies
three positive integers `k1`, `k2` and `k3` followed by a line with the
ciphertext. Characters are partitioned into three groups:

1. `a`–`i`
2. `j`–`r`
3. `s`–`z` and underscore `_`

Within each group, the encryption rotates the characters to the **left** by
`ki` positions, preserving the positions of characters from other groups.
The task is to decrypt, i.e. rotate the letters in each group to the **right**
by the specified amount. Input terminates with `0 0 0`.

## Algorithm
For each test case:
1. Collect the indices of characters belonging to each group.
2. For a group with positions `p0 … pn-1` and key `k`, build an array of the
   group letters and place them back after a right rotation by `k`:
   `result[pi] = letters[(i - k) mod n]`.
3. Apply the rotation sequentially for all three groups and output the final
   string.

## Complexity
Let `L` be the length of the string. Gathering positions and performing the
rotations each touch every character a constant number of times. Thus the
runtime is `O(L)` per test case and the memory usage is also `O(L)`.
