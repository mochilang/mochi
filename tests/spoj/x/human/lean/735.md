# [Minimum Diameter Spanning Tree](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MDST)

## Problem Summary
Given the adjacency list of a connected undirected graph with up to 1000 vertices, find the minimum possible diameter among all spanning trees of the graph. Multiple test cases are provided.

## Algorithm
1. For each vertex, run breadth-first search to compute the farthest distance to any other vertex (its eccentricity).
2. The graph's radius `r` is the smallest eccentricity.
3. Let `C` be the set of vertices whose eccentricity equals `r` (the graph centers).
4. If any two vertices in `C` are adjacent, a spanning tree with diameter `2*r - 1` exists by connecting BFS trees rooted at those centers. Otherwise, the minimum diameter is `2*r`.

Running BFS from every vertex costs `O(n * (n + m))`, which is feasible for `n <= 1000`.
