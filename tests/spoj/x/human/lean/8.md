# [Complete the Sequence!](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CMPLS)

## Problem Summary
Given the first `S` terms of a sequence, extend it with the next `C` values, assuming the sequence is generated by the lowest-degree polynomial fitting the provided terms.

## Algorithm
1. Build a table of forward differences from the initial sequence until the last row becomes constant.
2. To generate each additional value:
   - Append the constant to the bottom row.
   - Move upward, appending to each row the sum of its last element and the newly added value from the row below.
3. The appended values in the first row form the continuation of the sequence.

This finite difference method performs polynomial extrapolation in `O(S * C)` time.
