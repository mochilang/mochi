# [Continuous Fractions Again](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CFRAC2)

## Problem Summary
Given an ASCII-art representation of a simple continued fraction, compute the corresponding rational number \(p/q\). Each case starts with dimensions \(m\) and \(n\) followed by a matrix of characters where `.` denotes blank spaces, digits form numbers, and lines with `+` and `-` depict the nested fractions. Input terminates with `0 0`.

## Algorithm
1. Scan the matrix lines from top to bottom.
2. For every line containing a `+`, take the integer immediately to the left of it and append to the coefficient list.
3. Track the lowest line that contains digits but no `+`; append this number as the final coefficient.
4. Evaluate the continued fraction from the coefficients using the recurrence `(p, q) = (a*p + q, p)` starting from the last coefficient with initial `(p, q) = (a_last, 1)`.
5. Output `p q` for each test case.

This exploits the structure where each level of the fraction has a line formatted as `ai + -----` with numerators always equal to 1.
