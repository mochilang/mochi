# [Sorting Bank Accounts](https://www.spoj.com/problems/SBANK)

## Problem Summary
Given multiple test cases containing lists of bank account numbers, output each distinct account in ascending order with the number of times it appears. Account numbers are strings and must retain leading zeros. A blank line separates test cases in both input and output.

## Algorithm
1. For each test case:
   - Read `n` and then `n` account lines into an array.
   - Sort the array lexicographically.
   - Scan the sorted array, counting consecutive equal strings.
   - Print each unique account followed by its count.
   - Output an empty line if more test cases remain.

Sorting dominates the complexity, giving `O(n \log n)` time per test case and `O(n)` memory.
