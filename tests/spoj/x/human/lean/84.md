# [SHORTCUT - Shortcut](https://www.spoj.com/problems/SHORTCUT/)

## Problem Summary
Given a self-avoiding walk consisting of `N` segments of length 10 meters,
find the shortest horizontal or vertical segment ("shortcut") connecting two
break points of the walk.  Report the length of the shortcut, the indices of
the start and end break points (0-based), and the direction of travel.  If
multiple shortcuts of minimal length exist, choose the one that begins earlier
on the route; if still tied, choose the one that ends later.

## Algorithm
1. Build the coordinates of all `N+1` break points while traversing the move
   string.  Each step updates `(x, y)` by Â±1 in the corresponding direction.
2. Group break points by their `x` coordinate and by their `y` coordinate.
3. For each group, sort the contained points by the other coordinate.  The
   minimal distance between points sharing the same `x` (or `y`) must occur
   between some pair of consecutive points in this order.
4. Examine each consecutive pair and compute the shortcut length, start/end
   indices and direction.  Track the best candidate using the required
   tie-breaking rules.
5. Output the best shortcut's length, starting index, ending index and
   direction.

This procedure runs in `O(N log N)` time due to the sorting step and uses
`O(N)` additional memory.
