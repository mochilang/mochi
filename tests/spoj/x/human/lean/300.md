# CABLETV - Cable TV Network

Given an undirected network of at most 50 relays, the *safety factor* is the
minimum number of relays whose removal disconnects the network.  A network that
remains connected no matter which relays are removed is considered perfectly
safe and its factor equals `n` (this only happens for a complete graph).
If the network is initially disconnected the factor is `0`.

To compute the safety factor we:

1. Build an adjacency matrix from the edge list.
2. Check if the graph is connected.  If not, output `0`.
3. If every pair of relays is directly connected, the graph is complete and the
   answer is `n`.
4. Otherwise compute the vertex connectivity.  For each pair of relays `(s, t)`
   we construct a flow network by splitting every vertex `v` into `v_in` and
   `v_out` with an edge `v_in → v_out` of capacity `1` (capacity `n` for `s` and
   `t`).  For each undirected edge `(u, v)` we add edges `u_out → v_in` and
   `v_out → u_in` with capacity `n`.  Running Edmonds–Karp max flow from `s_out`
   to `t_in` yields the minimum number of vertices separating `s` and `t`.
5. The safety factor is the minimum flow over all pairs `(s, t)`.

This algorithm runs comfortably within limits because `n ≤ 50`.
