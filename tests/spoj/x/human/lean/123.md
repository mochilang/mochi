## Problem Summary
Given a sum `n` (up to 10^1000), find the minimum number of coins whose denominations are powers of two such that the set of coins sums to `n` and is *perfect*: every value from `0` to `n` can be formed using some subset of the coins.

## Algorithm
1. Keep a running total `S` of the coin values chosen so far and a count `k`.
2. While `S < n`:
   - The next coin cannot exceed `S + 1`; otherwise some value in `(S, S + v)` would be unreachable.
   - Let `m = min(n - S, S + 1)` and take `v` as the largest power of two not exceeding `m`.
   - Add `v` to `S` and increment `k`.
3. When `S` reaches `n`, `k` is the minimal number of coins.

The greedy choice of the largest allowed power of two keeps the set perfect and minimizes the number of coins.

## Complexity
Let `k` be the number of coins in the optimal representation (roughly `O(log n)`). Each iteration performs logarithmic-time operations on big integers, so the overall complexity per test case is `O(k log n)`.
