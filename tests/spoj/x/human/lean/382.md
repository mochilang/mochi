# DECORATE - Decorate the wall

Given an axis-aligned wall with existing paintings, find coordinates for a new painting of fixed size such that it fits within the wall and does not overlap existing paintings. If multiple positions are possible choose the one with smallest y-coordinate, breaking ties with smallest x.

## Algorithm

1. Read all existing rectangles.
2. Candidate x positions are 0, the right edge `x2` of every painting, and `x1 - w'` (aligning the new right edge to a painting's left edge) if non-negative. Candidate y positions are defined similarly using `y2` and `y1 - h'`.
3. Filter candidates to keep only those within the wall bounds.
4. Sort candidate y values ascending and candidate x values ascending.
5. For each candidate `y` then `x`, test whether the new rectangle `[x, x+w') × [y, y+h')` overlaps any existing rectangle. Overlap test uses axis-aligned rectangle intersection checks.
6. The first pair passing all checks is the answer; if none are valid output `Fail!`.

The number of candidates is at most `2n + 1` on each axis, so at most about 160k placements are checked. Each check scans all `n ≤ 200` paintings, resulting in a fast solution.

## Correctness

- Every valid placement must have its left or right side aligned with `0` or some existing vertical edge; otherwise the painting can be slid left/right until this happens without introducing overlap. Therefore the set of candidate x positions is complete. The same applies for y positions.
- By iterating candidate y in ascending order and then x in ascending order, the first valid placement found has minimal y and among those minimal x.
- If no candidate passes the overlap test, any position would either exceed wall bounds or intersect an existing painting, so the answer is correctly `Fail!`.

## Complexity

Let `n ≤ 200` be the number of existing paintings. Each axis has at most `2n + 1` candidates, so at most `(2n+1)^2 ≤ 160{,}801` placements are examined. Checking one placement against all paintings takes `O(n)` time, yielding an overall complexity of `O(n^3)` in worst case but with a small constant (< 32 million checks), which runs quickly within the constraints.
