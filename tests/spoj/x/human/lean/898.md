# TRANSMIT - Transmitters

Given a fixed transmitter at `(cx, cy)` with radius `r`, we want to orient a semicircle of radius `r` to cover as many of the `N` given points as possible.

Algorithm:

1. For each point compute `dx = x - cx`, `dy = y - cy` and keep the point only if `dx^2 + dy^2 ≤ r^2`.
2. For every remaining point compute its polar angle using `atan2(dy, dx)`.
3. Sort all angles and duplicate the list with each angle plus `2π` to handle wrap‑around.
4. Using a two‑pointer sweep, for each angle `a[i]` advance `j` while `a[j] ≤ a[i] + π`.  The maximum window size over all `i` is the answer.

The complexity is `O(N log N)` per test case with `N ≤ 150`.
