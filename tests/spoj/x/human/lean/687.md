# [Repeats](https://www.spoj.com/problems/REPEATS)

## Problem Summary
Given a binary string, find a contiguous substring that is made from repeating a shorter seed string as many times as possible. The answer is the maximum number of repeats `k` over all substrings.

## Algorithm
1. Read the input string for each test case.
2. Convert the string to an array of characters for random access.
3. For every possible block length `l` from `1` to `n`:
   - For each starting index `i` such that a block of length `l` fits:
     - Count how many consecutive blocks of length `l` starting at `i` are identical.
     - Track the maximum repeat count found.
4. Output the largest repeat count.

This direct search examines all block sizes and starting positions, comparing character blocks directly. Its worstâ€‘case complexity is `O(n^2)`.
