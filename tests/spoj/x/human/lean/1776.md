## Problem Summary
We are given up to 15 DNA fragments consisting of the letters A, C, G and T. The goal is to
construct the shortest string that contains each fragment as a substring. If several strings
have the same minimal length, the lexicographically smallest one must be chosen.

## Algorithm
1. **Pruning** – Sort the fragments by length and discard any fragment that is already a
   substring of a longer one. This reduces the number of elements participating in the search.
2. **Overlap computation** – For every ordered pair `(i, j)` compute the length of the largest
   overlap where a suffix of fragment `i` matches a prefix of fragment `j`.
3. **Dynamic programming over subsets** – Let `dp[mask][i]` store the best superstring for the
   subset `mask` of fragments that ends with fragment `i`. Iterate over all masks and extend
   previously computed states by appending another fragment while using the precomputed overlap.
   When two candidates have equal length, keep the lexicographically smaller one.
4. The answer is the best string among all `dp[(1<<n)-1][i]`.

This bitmask DP runs in `O(n^2 · 2^n)` time and is feasible for `n ≤ 15`.
