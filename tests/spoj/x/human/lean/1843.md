# LEONARDO - Leonardo Notebook

Given a permutation of the 26 uppercase letters, decide whether it could be obtained by applying some permutation twice to the ordered alphabet.

## Algorithm

1. Convert the string into a list `perm` where position `i` stores the zero-based index of the letter that replaces `i`.
2. Build the cycle decomposition of `perm`:
   - For every unvisited index, follow the permutation until it returns to the start and record the cycle length.
3. For all recorded cycle lengths, verify that **every even length occurs an even number of times**. This criterion characterizes the permutations that are squares of another permutation.
4. Output `Yes` if the criterion holds, otherwise `No`.

## Correctness

- Any cycle of odd length can be produced by squaring a cycle of the same length.
- A cycle of even length `2k` must come in pairs to be produced as the square of some permutation. Squaring merges two disjoint `2k`-cycles into one `2k`-cycle, so an odd number of `2k`-cycles cannot have a square root.
- Therefore, the permutation is a square iff every even cycle length occurs an even number of times. The algorithm computes the cycle lengths and checks this property, hence it returns `Yes` exactly when the permutation is a square.

## Complexity

Let `n = 26`. Each element participates in exactly one cycle and is visited once, so computing the cycles is `O(n)` time. The counts are handled over at most `n` lengths, yielding overall `O(n)` time and `O(n)` additional space.
