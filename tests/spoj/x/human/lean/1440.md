# [Use of Function Arctan](https://www.spoj.com/problems/ARCTAN)

## Problem Summary
Given an integer A, find positive integers B and C such that
\(\arctan(1/A) = \arctan(1/B) + \arctan(1/C)\). Among all pairs (B, C)
satisfying the equation, output the minimum possible value of \(B + C\).

## Algorithm
1. Using the tangent addition formula, the equation becomes
   \( (B - A)(C - A) = A^2 + 1 \).
2. For \(N = A^2 + 1\), iterate over all divisors \(d\) of \(N\).
3. For each divisor, the corresponding pair is
   \(B = d + A\) and \(C = N/d + A\), giving
   \(B + C = d + N/d + 2A\).
4. Track the minimal value of \(d + N/d\) and add \(2A\) to obtain the
   minimal sum \(B + C\).

The divisor search runs in \(O(\sqrt{A^2 + 1})\) time per test case.
