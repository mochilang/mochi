# [A Game with Numbers](https://www.spoj.com/problems/NGM)

## Problem Summary
Nikifor and Trofim alternately subtract a non-zero digit from the current number. The player who writes zero wins. Given the initial number (less than 2 · 10⁹), determine the winner under optimal play, and if the first player wins, output a winning first move.

## Algorithm
1. Observe that any number divisible by 10 is losing: after subtracting any non-zero digit, the result is not divisible by 10 and thus is winning for the opponent.
2. For any other number, subtracting its last digit (which is non-zero) makes the number divisible by 10, handing the opponent a losing position.
3. Therefore:
   * If `n % 10 == 0`, Nikifor loses and we output `2`.
   * Otherwise, Nikifor wins; output `1` and the last digit `n % 10` as a winning move.

This strategy runs in constant time and uses only basic arithmetic.
