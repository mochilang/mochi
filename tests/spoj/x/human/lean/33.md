## Problem Summary
Given two strings (up to 80 lowercase letters) describing the routes of Alice and Bob, output every distinct longest common subsequence of the two strings in lexicographic order. Multiple test cases are provided.

## Algorithm
1. Convert both strings to arrays of characters.
2. Build a dynamic-programming table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` stores the length of the LCS of the suffixes starting at positions `i` and `j`.
3. Reconstruct all LCS strings via memoized recursion:
   - If the current characters match, prepend the character to every sequence from the state `(i+1, j+1)`.
   - Otherwise, follow directions that preserve the optimal length: move to `(i+1, j)` when `dp[i+1][j] ≥ dp[i][j+1]` and to `(i, j+1)` when `dp[i][j+1] ≥ dp[i+1][j]`.
   - Combine results from explored branches and remove duplicates.
4. Sort the resulting strings lexicographically and print them, separating test cases with a blank line.

This approach lists all longest common subsequences while avoiding redundant exploration through memoization and deduplication.
