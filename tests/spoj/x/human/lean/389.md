## Problem Summary
Simulate a day's operation of a hospital. Each patient is processed in roster order: they occupy the lowest-numbered available operating room, then after surgery and a fixed transport time are moved to the lowest-numbered available recovery bed. After each use, rooms and beds require a fixed preparation time before becoming available again. The program must report the schedule of every patient and the utilization statistics of all rooms and beds.

## Algorithm
1. **Parse input** containing hospital configuration and patient list. Times are tracked in minutes from the start hour.
2. **Schedule surgeries.** Maintain for each operating room the earliest time it becomes free. For each patient, pick the room with the smallest next free time (breaking ties by room number), record begin/end times, and update the room's next free time and usage.
3. **Assign recovery beds.** Create events for patient arrival to recovery (surgery end + transport). Sort events by arrival time and operating room number. For each event, choose the lowest-numbered bed whose preparation time has finished, start the recovery at the arrival time, and update bed availability and usage.
4. **Produce output.** Convert minutes back to `h:mm` format and print the patient table followed by facility utilization. Utilization percentage for each room/bed is computed over the interval from the day's start to the last recovery completion.

The number of patients is at most 100, with up to 10 operating rooms and 30 beds, so the simulation runs comfortably within the limits.
