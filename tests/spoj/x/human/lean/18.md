## Problem Summary
Given the encrypted three-digit integer obtained by subtracting 1 from the original value, recover the original number.

## Algorithm
1. Read the integer `x` from input.
2. Output `x + 1` to reverse the encryption.

This solution performs a single addition and operates in constant time and space.
