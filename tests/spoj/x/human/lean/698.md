# PLHOP - Plane Hopping

We are given an `N × N` matrix of ticket costs where entry `(i,j)` is the cost to fly
from city `i` to city `j`.  A traveler insists on taking at least `K` flights between
any two cities.  Since all costs are non‑negative, the cheapest trip with at least `K`
flights is obtained with exactly `K` flights.

Treat the matrix as the adjacency matrix of a complete graph and perform matrix
exponentiation in the min‑plus semiring ("addition" is `min`, "multiplication" is `+`).
Binary exponentiation gives the matrix `A^K` in `O(N^3 log K)` time.
The resulting matrix entry `(i,j)` is the minimal cost to travel from `i` to `j`
using at least `K` flights.
