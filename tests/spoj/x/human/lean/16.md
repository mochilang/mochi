# [Sphere in a tetrahedron](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TETRA)

## Problem Summary
Given the six edge lengths of a tetrahedron (WX, WY, WZ, XY, XZ, YZ), compute the radius of the sphere tangent to all four faces.

## Algorithm
1. Interpret the edges as a tetrahedron with vertices W, X, Y, Z.
2. Set W at the origin, X on the x-axis, and Y in the xy-plane using the given lengths to solve for its coordinates.
3. Solve for the coordinates of Z from the remaining edge lengths.
4. The tetrahedron volume is `|WX × WY ⋅ WZ| / 6`, which simplifies to `a * v * z / 6` under this coordinate system.
5. Compute each face's area via Heron's formula and sum them to obtain the surface area.
6. The inscribed sphere's radius is `r = 3 * volume / surface`.
7. Output the radius rounded to four decimal places for each test case.

This approach uses only basic geometric formulas and floating‑point arithmetic.
