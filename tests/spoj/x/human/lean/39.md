# [PIGBANK - Piggy-Bank](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PIGBANK/)

We are given the weight of an empty pig `E` and the weight of the full pig `F`.
The coins used in the piggy-bank are described by pairs `(value, weight)` and
can be used in unlimited quantity.  Let `W = F - E` be the total weight of the
coins inside.  The task is to find the minimal total monetary value of coins
whose combined weight is exactly `W`, or report that such combination is
impossible.

This is a classic **unbounded knapsack** (or coin change) problem.  We maintain
an array `dp[w]` storing the minimal value achievable with total weight `w`.
The table is initialized with a very large value (`INF`) except for
`dp[0] = 0`.  For every weight from `1` to `W` we try every coin: if a coin with
weight `cw` fits into the current weight `w`, we consider the candidate
`dp[w - cw] + value`.  The minimum over all candidates becomes `dp[w]`.
Finally, if `dp[W]` is still `INF` there is no solution; otherwise it is the
answer.

The complexity is `O(W * N)` where `N` is the number of coin types and
`W â‰¤ 10000`, which easily fits within the limits.
