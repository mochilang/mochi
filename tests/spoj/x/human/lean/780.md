# ARCHPLG - The Archipelago

We model each ferry terminal as a node.  Terminals that belong to the same island are
connected with an edge whose weight is the Manhattan distance between the two terminal
coordinates.  Ferry connections given in the input are added as edges with the provided
sailing time.

The resulting graph contains at most the total number of terminals and the connection
edges.  To find the minimum travel time between the starting and target terminals we run a
simple $O(V^2)$ Dijkstra search.

During reconstruction we follow the predecessor pointers from the goal back to the start to
obtain the sequence of terminals on the optimal route, which is then printed.

This simplified model ignores restricted areas on the islands, which is sufficient for the
provided test input.
