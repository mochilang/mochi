## Problem Summary
Given multiple word search puzzles and lists of words, locate each word exactly once in the grid. For each word output the zero-based row and column of its first letter and an orientation code `A`..`H` representing north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest respectively. Output words in the same order as given and print a blank line between test cases.

## Algorithm
1. Read the grid and build a map from each character to all positions that contain it.
2. For each word:
   - Look up all positions of its first letter.
   - For each such position, test all eight directions.
   - To test a direction, step through the grid while characters match and indices stay in bounds.
   - When all characters match, output the starting coordinates and the direction letter.
3. After each test case except the last, output a blank line.

This approach is efficient because it only examines positions that match the first letter of each word and each word is verified in at most eight directions.
