# Greedy Hydra (DRAGON)

We are given a weighted tree with `N` fruits (nodes).  The tree must be divided
into exactly `M` connected groups by cutting some edges.  The component that
contains the special fruit `1` must contain exactly `K` nodes.  Cutting an edge
adds its weight to a cost that we want to minimise.

This is a classic tree dynamic programming problem.  For every node `u` we keep
`dp[u][s][g]` – the minimum cost within the subtree of `u` if the component that
contains `u` has size `s` and the subtree is partitioned into `g` groups.  We
also store `best[u][g] = min_s dp[u][s][g]` for the case where the edge to the
parent is cut.

For a node `u` we start with a base state representing only `u`.
Processing a child `v` with edge weight `w` is a knapsack–style merge:

* **Keep the edge `u‑v`** – the component sizes add and the group count decreases
  by one: `g_new = g_u + g_v - 1`.
* **Cut the edge** – the child subtree contributes its own groups and we pay the
  edge weight: `g_new = g_u + g_v` and add `w` to the cost.

After merging all children we compute `best[u]` by taking the minimum over `s`.
The answer is `dp[1][K][M]`; if it is infinity then the partition is
impossible.

The complexity is `O(N * K * M)` which is feasible for the constraints
(`N ≤ 300`).
