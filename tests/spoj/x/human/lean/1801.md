# SPOJ DRINK - Drink, on Ice

Given masses of water `mw` and ice `mi` with temperatures `tw` and `ti`, compute the equilibrium of mixing them in an isolated system.
Specific heats: `cw = 4.19 J/(g*K)` for water and `ci = 2.09 J/(g*K)` for ice.
Melting (or freezing) one gram of water requires `em = 335 J`.

Energy reasoning leads to three cases:

1. **Water provides more heat** `Qw = mw*cw*tw` than needed to warm ice to `0째C` `Qi = mi*ci*(-ti)`.
   - `leftover = Qw - Qi` heats/melts ice.
   - If `leftover >= mi*em`: all ice melts and remaining energy heats the water: 
     `T = (leftover - mi*em)/((mw + mi)*cw)`.
   - Else: only `melted = leftover/em` grams of ice melt. Mixture stays at `0째C` with `mi-melted` ice and `mw+melted` water.
2. **Exact balance** `Qw = Qi`: mixture ends at `0째C` with `mi` ice and `mw` water.
3. **Water provides less heat** `Qw < Qi`: all water freezes and the final temperature is below `0째C`.
   `T = (mw*cw*tw + mw*em + mi*ci*ti)/((mw + mi)*ci)` with total ice mass `mw + mi`.

Output: `"<ice> g of ice and <water> g of water at <temp> C"` where each value is rounded to one decimal place.
