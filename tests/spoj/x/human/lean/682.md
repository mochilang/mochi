# [Pairs of Integers](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PAIRINT/)

## Problem Summary
Given an integer `N`, find all pairs `(X, Y)` such that `X + Y = N`,
`Y` is obtained from `X` by deleting exactly one decimal digit, `X`
has at least two digits and starts with a non-zero digit, while `Y`
may start with zero. For each test case output the number of pairs and
then the pairs sorted by increasing `X` as `X + Y = N`.

## Algorithm
1. For each digit position `k` (powers of ten `pow = 10^k` up to `N`):
   - Let `rem = N mod pow`. Possible low parts of `Y` are
     `rem/2` (if `rem` even) or `(rem+pow)/2` (if even), since `N mod pow`
     equals `2*low` modulo `pow`.
2. For each candidate `low`:
   - Compute `N2 = N - 2*low`. If `N2` is divisible by `pow`, set
     `q = N2 / pow`.
   - The removed digit is `digit = q mod 11` and the higher prefix is
     `high = q / 11`. If `digit ≤ 9`, reconstruct
     `X = high*pow*10 + digit*pow + low` and
     `Y = high*pow + low`.
   - Accept the pair if `X ≥ 10`, `X ≥ pow` (digit at position `k`
     exists), and `X + Y = N`.
3. Store each valid `X` once to avoid duplicates and sort pairs by `X`.
   `Y` is printed with leading zeros to have one fewer digit than `X`.

The loop over digit positions runs at most nine times (since `N ≤ 10^9`),
so the algorithm runs in `O(log_{10} N)` time.
