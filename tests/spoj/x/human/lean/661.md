# QUEST5 - Nail Them

Each plank is an interval \([a,b]\) on a line. We must place the minimum
number of nails (points) so every interval contains at least one nail.

Sort the intervals by their right endpoint. Traverse them in this order
and maintain the position of the last nail placed. For the current plank
\([a,b]\):

- if the last nail lies inside (i.e. `last â‰¥ a`), it already covers this
  plank;
- otherwise place a new nail at position `b` and update `last`.

This greedy strategy is optimal because choosing the rightmost possible
nail always leaves maximal room for covering subsequent planks. Sorting
takes `O(n log n)` per table and the sweep is linear.
