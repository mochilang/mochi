# [Mark-up](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MARKUP)

## Problem Summary
Given text containing a simple mark-up language, remove all formatting commands and output the plain text. Recognized commands begin with a backslash and include toggling bold or italics, setting a font size with an optional decimal number, and `\*` which toggles whether commands are processed.

## Algorithm
1. Read the entire input as a string while keeping a flag that indicates whether mark-up processing is enabled (initially on).
2. Scan the string character by character:
   - When not processing mark-ups, output every character verbatim except that `\*` still toggles processing back on.
   - When processing mark-ups:
     - `\b` and `\i` are removed.
     - `\s` is removed along with any following digits and at most one decimal point and digits.
     - `\*` toggles processing on/off without producing output.
     - Any other `\x` outputs `x` literally.
3. All non-mark-up characters are copied directly to the output.

The procedure runs in a single pass over the input and uses constant additional memory.
