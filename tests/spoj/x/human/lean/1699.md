## Problem Summary
Given two numbers in Prof. Hachioji's MCXI numeral system, compute their sum and output the result in the same MCXI format. Each MCXI string uses letters `m`, `c`, `x`, `i` representing 1000, 100, 10 and 1 respectively, optionally preceded by digits `2`–`9` to multiply the value of that letter. Each letter appears at most once and in the fixed order `m` → `c` → `x` → `i`.

## Algorithm
1. **Parsing**: For each MCXI string, traverse its characters. If a digit is found, multiply it by the value of the following letter and add to an accumulator. Otherwise, add the letter's value directly.
2. **Addition**: Sum the integer values of the two parsed strings.
3. **Encoding**: Convert the sum back to an MCXI string by processing the values in order `(1000,'m'), (100,'c'), (10,'x'), (1,'i')`. For each value:
   - Compute the digit `q` as integer division by the value.
   - If `q` is zero, skip.
   - If `q` is one, append the letter; otherwise append `q` followed by the letter.

This procedure guarantees a unique representation for numbers up to 9999 while using only simple arithmetic and string operations.
