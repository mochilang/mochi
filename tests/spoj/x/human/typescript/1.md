# TEST - Life, the Universe, and Everything

[Problem statement](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TEST/)

## Algorithm

Read integers from standard input one by one.
Output each integer on its own line until the value `42` appears,
which signals termination and is not printed.

## Correctness

The program iterates through the input in order. For each number:
- If it equals `42`, the loop breaks, so no further numbers are printed.
- Otherwise, the number is printed. 
Thus, all numbers before the first `42` are echoed exactly, and the first `42` and any following numbers are ignored, matching the specification.

## Complexity Analysis

Let `n` be the count of numbers read until `42` occurs (inclusive).
The algorithm processes each number once, resulting in `O(n)` time and `O(1)` additional space.
