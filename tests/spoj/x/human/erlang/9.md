# DIRVS - Direct Visibility

[Problem link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/DIRVS/)

## Algorithm
1. Parse the grid of terrain heights and the coordinates of the two BTS towers.
2. For every grid cell compute whether the line of sight to each BTS is clear. The
   check samples many points along the straight line and verifies the height is
   always above the terrain.
3. Perform a breadth-first search from the start BTS to the target BTS. Only
   moves to the four neighbouring cells are allowed. A step is valid when the
   neighbouring cell differs in height by at most +1 or -3 metres and it sees at
   least one BTS.
4. Return the length of the shortest path if found; otherwise output
   `Mission impossible!`.

This approach runs in \(O(P \cdot Q \cdot S + P \cdot Q)\) where \(S\) is the number
of samples used in the visibility test.
