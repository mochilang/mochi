## Problem Summary
Read integers from standard input and echo each to output until the sentinel value `42` appears. The number `42` and any numbers after it are not printed.

## Algorithm
1. Read a line using `read_line_to_codes/2`.
2. Convert the list of character codes to an integer via `number_codes/2`.
3. If the integer equals `42`, stop processing.
4. Otherwise, write the number with `format/2` and recurse.

This approach runs in linear time relative to the count of values and requires only constant additional memory.
