## Problem Summary
Echo each integer from input to output until the sentinel value `42` is read, after which terminate without printing `42` or any subsequent values.

## Algorithm
1. Read lines from standard input in a loop.
2. Convert each line to an integer.
3. If the number equals `42`, stop processing.
4. Otherwise, print the number.

This algorithm processes each input exactly once and uses constant extra memory.
