# TEST - Life, the Universe, and Everything

[Problem statement](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TEST/)

## Algorithm

1. Read integers from standard input line by line.
2. For each integer:
   - If the number is `42`, stop processing and terminate.
   - Otherwise, append the number to the output.
3. Print all collected numbers each on a separate line.

This directly implements the requirement to echo all numbers until `42` is encountered, using simple I/O without additional data structures.
