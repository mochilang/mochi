## Problem Summary
Given the arrival sequence of `n` trucks numbered `1..n`, determine if they can be reordered into increasing order using a side street that behaves like a stack. Trucks enter the side street in arrival order and can leave only in reverse order.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize `need = 1` and an empty stack.
2. For each truck in the arrival sequence:
   - While the stack's top equals `need`, pop it and increment `need`.
   - If the current truck equals `need`, send it directly to the output and increment `need`.
   - Otherwise, push the truck onto the stack.
3. After processing all trucks, pop from the stack while its top equals `need`.
4. If the stack is empty, output `yes`; otherwise output `no`.

This simulation runs in `O(n)` time per test case with `O(n)` extra space for the stack.
