# [Complete Chess Boards](https://www.spoj.com/problems/COMCB/)

## Problem Summary
Given the dimensions of a chess board (X rows and Y columns, with at most 26 squares in total), find the lexicographically first sequence of knight moves that visits every square exactly once. Squares are labeled by column letter followed by row number (e.g. `B4`). Output the concatenated sequence of square labels for the first tour in lexicographic order, or `-1` if no such tour exists.

## Algorithm
1. Enumerate all board squares and sort them lexicographically; try each as a starting square.
2. For each start, perform a depthâ€‘first search backtracking over knight moves:
   - Mark the current square as visited and append its label to the path.
   - If the path length equals the number of squares, record the path and stop.
   - Otherwise, gather all unvisited knight moves, label them, sort them lexicographically, and recurse.
   - Backtrack after exploring a move.
3. If any starting square yields a full tour, output the recorded path; otherwise output `-1`.

The board contains at most 26 squares, so exhaustive search with backtracking is feasible. Each position considers up to eight moves, giving manageable runtime under the small constraint.
