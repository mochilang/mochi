## Problem Summary
Given up to 100 tasks numbered 1..N and dependency rules of the form `T0 k T1 T2 ... Tk`, output an ordering of all tasks such that each task appears after the tasks it depends on. Among tasks that are independent of each other, choose the smallest numbered task first.

## Algorithm
1. Build a directed graph where each rule adds edges from every dependent `Ti` to the target `T0` and increments `T0`'s in-degree.
2. Repeatedly select the smallest-numbered task with in-degree zero, append it to the result, and decrement the in-degree of its neighbors.
3. Continue until all tasks are processed, then print the resulting sequence separated by spaces.

Selecting the smallest available vertex each step ensures the required ordering when multiple tasks are free of dependencies. With at most 100 tasks this simple O(N^2 + M) approach is sufficient.
