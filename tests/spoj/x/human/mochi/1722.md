## Problem Summary
Given integers `k` and `n`, construct the undirected graph with vertices `1..n` and an edge between `i` and `j` whenever `0 < |i-j| \le k`. All edges are unweighted. For each test case output the number of different minimum spanning trees modulo `65521`.

In an unweighted connected graph any spanning tree has minimal total weight, hence the task reduces to counting the spanning trees of this graph.

## Algorithm
1. Build the Laplacian matrix `L` for the graph. For vertices other than `n` keep the original degrees (including possible edges to vertex `n`) and set `L[i][j] = -1` when `|i-j| \le k`.
2. Remove the last row and column of `L` to obtain an `(n-1)×(n-1)` matrix `A`.
3. The Matrix–Tree Theorem states that the determinant of `A` equals the number of spanning trees. Compute `det(A)` using Gaussian elimination modulo `65521`.
4. Repeat for each test case.

This approach runs in `O(n^3)` time for a single case due to the determinant computation. It is sufficient for small inputs such as the provided example.
