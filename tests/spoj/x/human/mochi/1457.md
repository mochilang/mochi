## Problem Summary
Each equation uses digits `0-9`, `+`, `*` and `=`. H.L. replaced every symbol with a distinct letter `a`–`m` while preserving equality. Given the encoded equations, recover which letter–symbol relations are forced by the data.

## Algorithm
1. Mark which letters appear in the equations and find the letters that occur exactly once in every equation. Any such letter could represent `=`.
2. For each candidate `=` letter run a depth‑first search assigning the remaining letters to the remaining symbols (`0-9`, `+`, `*`). Only one‑to‑one mappings are considered and every complete assignment is checked by translating the equations and evaluating them with normal operator precedence.
3. Collect all mappings that satisfy all equations. For each letter keep the set of symbols it was mapped to across all valid assignments.
4. Output the letter→symbol pairs that are identical in every solution, in lexicographic order. If no assignment works, print `noway`.

This brute-force search is feasible because few distinct letters appear in the test cases.
