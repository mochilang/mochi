## Problem Summary
Given a directed graph representing one-way connections between planets, Kashyyyk is planet `1` and Alderaan is planet `n`. We must find the planet (other than `1`) that is present on **all** paths from `1` to `n` and is closest to planet `1`. If no such planet exists besides Alderaan, output `n`.

## Algorithm
For each test case:

1. Build an adjacency list for the directed graph.
2. Run a breadth-first search from node `1` to compute the distance of every reachable node from the start.
3. Initialize the answer as `n` with distance `dist[n]`.
4. For every node `v` from `2` to `n-1` that is reachable from node `1`:
   - Perform another BFS from `1` while skipping `v` (treat `v` as removed).
   - If Alderaan is no longer reachable, then `v` lies on all paths. Update the answer if `dist[v]` is smaller than the best distance found so far.
5. Output the node stored in the answer.

This approach checks each candidate node by temporarily removing it and verifying reachability of Alderaan. The algorithm is straightforward and correct for the constraints of the test data.
