# [Bytelandian gold coins](https://www.spoj.com/problems/COINS/)

## Problem Summary
In Byteland a coin of value `n` may be exchanged into three coins `⌊n/2⌋`, `⌊n/3⌋`, and `⌊n/4⌋`. Alternatively it can be sold for dollars at a 1:1 rate. Given several values of `n` (0 ≤ n ≤ 1 000 000 000) until EOF, output the maximum dollars obtainable from each coin.

## Algorithm
Use top‑down dynamic programming with memoization.

1. Define `f(n)` which returns the best dollar value.
2. If `n < 12`, simply return `n` because exchanging yields no profit.
3. Otherwise compute `s = f(n/2) + f(n/3) + f(n/4)` and return the larger of `n` and `s`.
4. Cache every computed `f(n)` in a map to avoid recomputation.

The recursion depth is logarithmic in `n`, and memoization ensures each value is evaluated only once.
