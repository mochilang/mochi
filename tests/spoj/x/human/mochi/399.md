# [Team Rankings](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TRANK/)

## Problem Summary
Given several orderings of the five teams A--E, find a ranking whose sum of pairwise disagreements with the given rankings is minimal. Each disagreement is counted when a pair of teams appears in a different relative order. The final ranking should be lexicographically smallest among those with minimal total disagreements.

## Algorithm
1. Pre-compute all 5! permutations of `ABCDE`.
2. For every input test set:
   - Convert each provided ranking into an array giving the position of each team.
   - For every candidate permutation:
       - Build its position array.
       - For each given ranking, count the ten pairwise disagreements with the candidate and accumulate the total value.
   - Track the permutation with the minimal value, breaking ties alphabetically.
3. Output the best ranking and its value.

This brute-force search runs in constant time per candidate (120 permutations) and `O(n)` for `n` input rankings.
