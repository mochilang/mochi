## Algorithm

1. Read the number of trees and their heights.
2. Compute the current disorder coefficient: `sum |h[i] - h[i+1]|`.
3. For each index `i`:
   - Start with the current coefficient as the best value.
   - For every index `j` (including `i`):
     * Swap the heights at positions `i` and `j`.
     * Recompute the disorder coefficient over the whole array.
     * Restore the original order.
     * Keep the minimum coefficient seen.
   - Output this minimal coefficient for index `i`.

The approach tries all possible swaps involving each tree and recomputes the total
cost each time. While cubic in the worst case, it is straightforward and
suffices for small inputs.

## Correctness

The disorder coefficient depends only on adjacent pairs. Swapping two elements
only changes the global coefficient through this direct recomputation, so by
trying every possible swap, we explore all configurations reachable with one
swap and record the minimal total.

## Complexity

For `n` trees, we evaluate `O(n^2)` swaps and each recomputation takes `O(n)`
operations, leading to overall `O(n^3)` time and `O(1)` additional space.
