# [The Cats and the Mouse](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CATM/)

## Problem Summary
Given an `n × m` grid (n,m ≤ 100), a mouse and two cats move in turns. The mouse moves first, then each cat moves one square
orthogonally. If the mouse reaches any edge it can jump off on its next move and escape; if a cat ever moves onto the mouse's
square the mouse is caught. For up to 10 test cases, determine whether the mouse can escape assuming optimal play from the cats.

## Algorithm
1. For every border cell of the grid compute the Manhattan distance from the mouse and from each cat.
2. The mouse can safely escape through a border cell if its distance to that cell is **strictly less** than the distances of
   both cats. If so, the cats cannot reach that cell in time to intercept the mouse.
3. Check all border cells; if any satisfies the above condition, output `YES`, otherwise output `NO`.

The Manhattan distance suffices because the grid has no obstacles. The algorithm runs in `O(n*m)` per test case, which is at most
10,000 iterations.
