## Problem Summary
Given several bus routes, each described by the "niceness" of roads between consecutive stops, find the nicest contiguous segment to cycle for each route. A segment's niceness is the sum of its road niceness values. If multiple segments have the same maximal niceness, prefer the longest one; if still tied, choose the earliest starting stop. If no segment has positive niceness, report that the route has no nice parts.

## Algorithm
For each route:
1. Read the number of stops `s` and the `s-1` niceness values.
2. Scan the niceness values using a variant of Kadane's algorithm.
   - Maintain `current` sum and the starting stop of the current segment.
   - When `current` becomes negative, reset it to zero and start a new segment.
   - Track the best segment (`best`, `bestStart`, `bestEnd`). Update it when
     * the current sum is greater than the best sum, or
     * the sums are equal but the current segment is longer.
3. After processing all roads, if `best > 0` output the stored stops; otherwise
   report that the route has no nice parts.

This guarantees the earliest start is kept for ties in length because segments are only replaced when strictly longer.

## Complexity
For each route we examine each road once, so the algorithm runs in `O(s)` time and `O(1)` extra space.
