## Problem Summary
Given required volumes of oxygen and nitrogen and a set of available cylinders, each with certain amounts of these gases and a weight, find the minimal total weight of cylinders that provides at least the required gases. Multiple test cases.

## Algorithm
1. Use dynamic programming where `dp[o][n]` holds the minimal weight to achieve at least `o` oxygen and `n` nitrogen.
2. Initialize `dp` with infinity except `dp[0][0] = 0`.
3. For each cylinder `(oxy, nit, w)` update `dp` in reverse order:
   - `no = min(needO, o + oxy)`
   - `nn = min(needN, n + nit)`
   - `dp[no][nn] = min(dp[no][nn], dp[o][n] + w)`
4. The answer is `dp[needO][needN]`.

The DP has complexity `O(n * needO * needN)` with at most 22Ã—80 states, which is efficient.
