# [GX Light Pipeline Inc](https://www.spoj.com/problems/LITEPIPE)

## Problem Summary
Given the polyline describing the upper contour of a pipe and the lower contour exactly one unit below, determine the largest
x-coordinate that light emitted from the vertical segment at the leftmost point can reach before hitting the pipe walls.
If the light can travel through the entire pipe, return the final x-coordinate.

## Algorithm
1. Store the upper points `up[i] = (xi, yi)` and compute the lower points `down[i] = (xi, yi-1)`.
2. For every pair `(i, j)` with `i != j`, consider the line through `up[i]` and `down[j]`.
3. Traverse the pipe segments in order and check whether this line intersects every vertical segment of the pipe:
   - If it does, the light passes completely and the answer is `x_n`.
   - Otherwise, find the first segment that the line misses. Intersect the line with the adjoining upper and lower edges and
     record the furthest x-coordinate reached.
4. Take the maximum x over all lines and print it with two decimal places.

This brute-force approach enumerates at most `n^2` candidate lines (with `n <= 200`), which is efficient for the given constraints.
