# [Bishops](https://www.spoj.com/problems/BISHOPS/)

## Problem Summary
Given an integer N representing the size of an N×N chessboard (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^100), determine the maximum number of bishops that can be placed so that no two attack each other. Multiple values of N are provided, one per line, until EOF.

## Algorithm
1. For each input value N read it as a big integer.
2. If N is 1, output 1.
3. Otherwise compute 2*N - 2 and output the result.

The formula comes from placing bishops on both colored diagonals; for N>1, each color contributes N-1 bishops. All operations use big integer arithmetic. The algorithm runs in constant time per input.
