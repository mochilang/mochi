# WM06 - Soccer Choreography

We are given an initial and final formation of players. Each player has a
unique number and an orientation. A single move chooses a contiguous block of
players, reverses their order and flips their orientation (a 180Â° turn). Our
goal is to transform the initial formation into the target formation.

## Algorithm

The implemented solution uses a variant of the burnt pancake sorting algorithm:

1. Work from the end of the target formation towards the beginning.
2. For position `k` (starting at `n-1` and decreasing):
   - Locate index `j` where the player with number `|target[k]|` currently
     resides.
   - If `j == k` and the orientation already matches, continue.
   - If the player is at position `j` with the wrong orientation, flip the
     single element segment `[j,j]` to correct its orientation.
   - Flip the segment `[j,k]` to bring the player to position `k` with the
     desired orientation.
3. Record each flip as a pair `(i, j)`; applying all flips sequentially yields
   one valid choreography. The number of flips is printed along with the
   intermediate formations.

This greedy method runs in `O(n^2)` time and produces one sequence of moves that
transforms the initial arrangement to the goal arrangement.
