## Algorithm

We search for a sub-cuboid of a three‑dimensional array whose elements have the
maximum possible sum.

1. Iterate over all pairs of starting and ending layers along the `x`
   direction. For each pair accumulate the values of the layers into a
   temporary `y × z` matrix.
2. For the temporary matrix run the classic 2‑D maximum sub‑rectangle
   algorithm: for every pair of starting and ending rows accumulate their
   values by columns and apply Kadane's 1‑D maximum subarray algorithm to that
   column array. This yields the best `z` segment for the chosen rows.
3. The best combination of `x`, `y`, and `z` bounds and its sum is tracked
   throughout the search.

The final answer is the coordinates of the two opposite corners of the cuboid.

## Complexity

Let `x`, `y`, and `z` be the dimensions of the cube (≤50).  The outer loop over
layer pairs is `O(x²)` and the inner 2‑D search is `O(y²·z)`, giving an overall
complexity of `O(x² · y² · z)`, which is fast enough for the given limits.
