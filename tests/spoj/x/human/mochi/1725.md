# [IMPORT1 - The Importance](https://www.spoj.com/problems/IMPORT1/)

We compute for each vertex the sum over all unordered pairs of distinct vertices of the fraction of shortest paths between the pair that pass through the vertex.

The algorithm is Brandes' betweenness centrality for weighted graphs:

1. For each source run Dijkstra's algorithm tracking the number of shortest paths and predecessor lists.
2. Process vertices in reverse order of distance to accumulate dependency values to predecessors.
3. Add the dependencies to vertex scores and divide by two for the undirected graph.
4. Output each score with three decimals.

The complexity is \(O(nm \log n)\) for \(n \le 100\) and \(m \le 4500\).
