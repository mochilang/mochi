## Problem Summary
Given positions of passengers and taxis on a square grid (200 m between intersections), each taxi of speed `s` must reach a passenger within `c` seconds and can take only one passenger. Find the maximum number of passengers that can be picked up.

## Algorithm
1. Compute Manhattan distances between each taxi and passenger and convert to meters. If `distance <= s * c`, add an edge between them.
2. On this bipartite graph, perform a DFS-based augmenting path algorithm to find a maximum matching between taxis and passengers.
3. The matching size is the answer.

With ≤200 taxis and ≤400 passengers the graph has at most 80k edges, so this approach runs quickly.
