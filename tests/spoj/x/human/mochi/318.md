1. For a given N compute T = 2*N + 1. Factor T into primes and for each prime p add exponent e = (p-1)/2 to a list.  Sort exponents descending and assign them to the smallest primes congruent to 1 mod 4 to minimise the hypotenuse R.
2. Compute R = \prod p_i^{e_i}.  The number of right triangles with hypotenuse R equals (\prod (2*e_i + 1) - 1)/2 which matches N.
3. For every prime factor p_i^{e_i} of R, find integers (a,b) with a^2 + b^2 = p_i.  Using Gaussian integer multiplication generate all representations of R^2 as sums of two squares by combining (a + b i)^k (a - b i)^{2e_i - k} for k=0..2e_i across all primes.
4. From the generated pairs (x,y) with x^2 + y^2 = R^2 discard the trivial x=0, y=R and duplicates.  For each remaining pair take the smaller leg x and sort the list to output catheti.
