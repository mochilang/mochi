# [Pythagorean Legacy](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PITPAIR/)

## Problem Summary
Given an integer N, find the smallest hypotenuse R such that exactly N distinct right triangles with integer side lengths have hypotenuse R. For that R, output R and then the shorter leg of each triangle in ascending order. Each triangle must have integer sides and be unique.

## Algorithm
1. For each test case with target count N start with c = 5 and increment c until a value with exactly N triangles is found.
2. For each candidate c compute c^2 and scan all possible legs a from 1 to c-1.
   - Let b² = c² − a². If b² is a perfect square and a < b, record a as the shorter leg.
3. Once the number of recorded legs equals N, sort them and output c followed by the legs.

The search stops at the first hypotenuse producing the required count. Integer square roots are computed by incremental search and sorting uses insertion sort. The method is sufficient for small N and ensures the legs are listed in ascending order.
