# [Containers](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CTAIN/)

## Problem Summary
Given up to four containers, each initially full with a known capacity, we can:

1. Pour the entire content of one container into another if it fits.
2. Pour from one container into another until the latter becomes full.
3. Empty a container into the drain.

For each test case, determine the minimum number of moves needed to reach a
requested distribution of water in the containers, or report `NO` if it is
impossible.

## Algorithm
- Represent the state as the amount of water in each container.  Start with all
  containers full.
- Perform a breadth‑first search over states to find the shortest sequence of
  moves to reach the target state.
- From any state generate neighbors by:
  - Emptying each non‑empty container.
  - Pouring from container `i` to `j` (for all `i ≠ j`), transferring
    `min(current[i], capacity[j] - current[j])` units.
- Encode states as base‑50 integers for use in a visited map to avoid
  revisiting states.
- The first time the goal state is dequeued the distance is the minimal number
  of moves; if the search exhausts all states without reaching the goal
  output `NO`.

The state space is bounded by at most `50^n` (for `n ≤ 4`), so BFS runs in
`O(S · n^2)` time and `O(S)` space where `S` is the number of reachable states.
