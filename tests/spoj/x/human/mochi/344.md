## Problem Summary
Given five playing cards, determine the category of the poker hand. Cards are described by rank (`A`, `K`, `Q`, `J`, `T`, `9`-`2`) and suit (`S`, `H`, `D`, `C`). For each test case print one of:
"royal flush", "straight flush", "four of a kind", "full house", "flush", "straight", "three of a kind", "two pairs", "pair", or "high card".

## Algorithm
1. Parse the five cards, mapping each rank to a numeric value and checking whether all suits match (flush).
2. Sort the rank values and check if they form a consecutive sequence, allowing the special case `A,2,3,4,5` (straight).
3. Group equal ranks to obtain their multiplicities.
4. Using the flush/straight flags and the sorted multiplicities, classify the hand in priority order:
   - `royal flush`: straight flush starting at ten.
   - `straight flush`
   - `four of a kind`
   - `full house`
   - `flush`
   - `straight`
   - `three of a kind`
   - `two pairs`
   - `pair`
   - `high card` (none of the above).

The solution performs only fixed-size loops, running in constant time per hand.
