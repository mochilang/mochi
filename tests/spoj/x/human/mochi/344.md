## Problem Summary
Given five distinct playing cards per test case (up to 20 cases), classify the poker hand into one of ten categories (royal flush, straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush, straight, three of a kind, two pairs, pair, or high card).

## Algorithm
1. Parse the five cards, mapping rank characters to numeric values and recording suits.
2. Check if all suits match (flush).
3. Sort the ranks and detect a consecutive sequence, treating `A 2 3 4 5` as a low straight.
4. Count how many times each rank appears to detect pairs, three-, or four-of-a-kind.
5. Evaluate the hand by applying the categories in priority order:
   - Royal flush: flush and ranks `10 11 12 13 14`.
   - Straight flush: flush and straight.
   - Four of a kind: some rank appears four times.
   - Full house: a three-of-a-kind plus a pair.
   - Flush: all suits equal.
   - Straight: consecutive ranks.
   - Three of a kind: some rank appears three times.
   - Two pairs: two different ranks appear twice.
   - Pair: one rank appears twice.
   - High card: none of the above.

This approach runs in constant time per hand.
