# SCANNER - Scanner

The scanner surrounds a 10×15 grid with four arrays of sensors:

- Array 1 (10 sensors) measures the number of filled cells in each row.
- Array 3 (15 sensors) measures the number of filled cells in each column.
- Array 2 and Array 4 (24 sensors each) measure counts along the two sets of diagonals: \(i+j\) and \(i-j\).

Given these sums, the task is to reconstruct one possible grid using `#` for filled and `.` for empty cells.

## Algorithm
1. Precompute for every cell its row, column, and both diagonal indices, and how many cells belong to each diagonal.
2. Read the four sensor arrays. Reverse Array 4 so its order matches the diagonal indexing.
3. Use depth‑first search with backtracking over all 150 cells. Cells are ordered by decreasing `(rowSum + colSum)` to prune faster.
4. When trying a value for a cell, update the remaining sums for its row, column, and diagonals. If any sum becomes negative or exceeds the remaining available cells, backtrack.
5. Once all cells are assigned and all sums reach zero, output the grid.

The constraints are small, so this backtracking search quickly finds a valid configuration. Any configuration satisfying all sums is acceptable.
