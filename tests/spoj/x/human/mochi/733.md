# [MTWALK - Mountain Walking](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MTWALK/)

## Problem Summary
Given an \(N \times N\) grid of elevations, start at the top-left cell and reach the bottom-right cell. You may move in four cardinal directions and want a path where the difference between the highest and lowest elevation on the path is minimal. Output that minimal possible difference.

## Algorithm
1. Read \(N\) and the elevation matrix.
2. Collect all unique elevation values and sort them.
3. Binary search the answer \(D\) = maximum minus minimum elevation along the path.
   - For each candidate \(D\), try every possible lower bound `low` from the unique elevations.
   - If both start and end cells lie inside `[low, low + D]`, perform a BFS restricted to cells with elevation in this interval.
   - If BFS reaches the goal for any `low`, the candidate `D` is feasible.
4. The minimal `D` found by binary search is the answer.

The grid has at most 10,000 cells, making BFS inexpensive. Binary search over the elevation range gives a time complexity of roughly \(O(U \log R)\), where \(U\) is the number of unique elevations (â‰¤10,000) and \(R\) is the elevation range.
