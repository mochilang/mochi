# [A Very Easy Problem!](https://www.spoj.com/problems/EASYPROB/)

## Problem Summary
Output the canonical representation of the numbers `137`, `1315`, `73`, `136`, `255`, `1384` and `16385` with no input. Each number must be written as a sum of powers of two, where every exponent is recursively expanded in the same format. Exponents `1` and `0` are represented as `2` and `2(0)` respectively.

## Algorithm
1. Define function `format(n)` that returns the required representation.
   - If `n == 0` return `"0"`.
   - Scan bits of `n` from most significant to least significant.
   - For each set bit at position `i`:
     - If `i == 0`, append `"2(0)"`.
     - Else if `i == 1`, append `"2"`.
     - Else append `"2(" + format(i) + ")"`.
   - Join all parts with `'+'` to form the final string.
2. For each constant in `[137, 1315, 73, 136, 255, 1384, 16385]` print `n=format(n)`.

This recursively decomposes each number into powers of two and formats both the numbers and their exponents as required.
