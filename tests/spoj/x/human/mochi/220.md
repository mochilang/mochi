## Problem Summary
Given multiple lowercase messages, find the maximum length of a substring that appears **at least twice disjointly** in every message. A substring is considered disjoint if its occurrences do not overlap.

## Algorithm
1. For a candidate length `L`, compute all substrings of length `L` that occur at least twice without overlapping in each message.
   - Scan each message while tracking the first occurrence of every `L`-length substring.
   - When the same substring reappears `>= L` characters later, mark it as valid for that message.
2. Intersect the sets of valid substrings across all messages. If the intersection is non-empty, some substring of length `L` satisfies the condition.
3. Use binary search on `L` from `1` to the minimum message length to find the largest valid length.

The check for a fixed `L` runs in `O(n * m)` time where `n` is the number of messages and `m` is the message length. Binary search adds a logarithmic factor, yielding overall complexity `O(n * m * log m)` with linear memory.
