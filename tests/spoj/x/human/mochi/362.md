## Problem Summary
A ticket machine displays numbers starting from 1 and increasing by 1 each second. Because the display is mounted upside down, we only see numbers that remain valid when rotated by 180°. Valid digits are {0,1,2,5,6,8,9} and the rotated number is read in reverse order with 6 and 9 swapped. For a given K, output the K‑th number that appears on the upside‑down display (leading zeros allowed).

## Algorithm
1. The set of valid numbers corresponds to counting in base 7 using digits `{0,1,2,5,6,8,9}` ordered by value.
2. Convert the decimal string `K` to base 7 using long division on the string.
3. Map each base‑7 digit to its corresponding allowed digit to obtain the original number before rotation.
4. Reverse this number and replace each digit using the upside‑down mapping `{0→0,1→1,2→2,5→5,6↔9,8→8}`.
5. Print the resulting string.

The conversion works for `K ≤ 10^200`. Each query runs in `O(L^2)` time for a `L`‑digit input and uses minimal extra space.
