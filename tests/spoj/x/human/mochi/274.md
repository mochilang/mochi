# [Johnny and the Watermelon Plantation](https://www.spoj.com/problems/WMELON/)

## Problem Summary
Given `n` watermelon plants at integer coordinates `(x, y)` with `f` fruits on each plant, find the smallest possible area of an axis-aligned rectangle that covers at least `k` fruits in total. The rectangle edges must be parallel to the axes and may touch plants on their boundary.

## Algorithm
1. **Coordinate Compression**
   - Collect all distinct `x` and `y` values and sort them.
   - Map each plant to indices in these sorted lists. Build a grid `grid[x][y]` storing total fruits at each coordinate.
2. **Enumerate Left and Right Boundaries**
   - For every `left` index in `0..X-1`:
     - Initialize an array `arr` of size `Y` with zeros.
     - For `right` from `left` to `X-1`:
       - Add column `right` of `grid` to `arr`.
       - Using a two-pointer technique over `arr`, find the minimal vertical span whose fruit sum is at least `k`.
       - Update the answer with `area = (xs[right] - xs[left]) * height`.
3. **Two-Pointer over Y**
   - The array `arr` contains non-negative values so we can slide `bottom` from `0..Y-1`, maintaining a running sum and moving `top` forward while the sum is `>= k` to minimize height.

## Complexity
Let `X` and `Y` be the number of distinct x and y coordinates (â‰¤ `n`). For each pair of x-indices we scan the Y array, resulting in `O(X^2 * Y)` time and `O(XY)` memory.
