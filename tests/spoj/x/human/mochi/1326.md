# [A Chase In WonderLand](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CHASE/)

## Problem Summary
Given up to 2200 safe spots on a plane, Alice may start on any spot and then jump from spot to spot only along a single straight line without changing direction. Determine the maximum number of jumps she can make for each test case.

## Algorithm
1. Read all points for the test case.
2. For each point `i`, compute slopes to every other point `j > i`.
   * Normalize each slope by dividing `dx` and `dy` by their greatest common divisor and fixing the sign so equal slopes share the same representation.
   * Count how many points share each slope using a map; track duplicates of point `i`.
3. The number of collinear points through `i` is `max_count + duplicates + 1`.
4. Track the global maximum over all `i` and subtract one to report the number of jumps.

This approach runs in `O(k^2)` time per test case and uses `O(k)` additional space.
