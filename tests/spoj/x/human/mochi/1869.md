# SPOJ 1869 - Macro Processor

Problem statement: https://www.spoj.com/problems/MKMOOM/

## Algorithm

We implement a miniature macro processor that interprets an input stream and
expands macro calls.

* Macros are stored in a map from name to definition string. The special macro
  `def` defines new macros and produces no output.
* The input is scanned character by character. Whenever `[` is encountered a
  recursive parser reads the macro call, evaluating the macro name and each
  argument from left to right. Nested macro calls and `<...>` literals are
  handled during this scan.
* For a macro call `name` with arguments `args`, its definition is scanned and
  occurrences of `$0`â€¦`$9` are replaced by the macro name or corresponding
  arguments. The resulting string is expanded recursively.
* Text enclosed in `<` and `>` is copied verbatim without any further
  processing. All other characters are appended directly to the output.

Each test case resets the macro table and runs the processor on the given text
lines, preserving all newline characters. The final output is wrapped with a
header and footer as required by the problem statement.

## Complexity

Let *N* be the length of the input text for one case. Each character is
processed a constant number of times, yielding a time complexity of `O(N)` and
an auxiliary space complexity of `O(N)` for recursion and macro storage.
