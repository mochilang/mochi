# Cave Exploration

## Algorithm

- Store horizontal and vertical corridors separately with their endpoints
  sorted.
- Simulate the explorer following the left-hand rule.
  - From the starting corridor and direction, mark corridors as visited.
  - Moving along a corridor, search the nearest intersection in the travel
    direction by scanning perpendicular corridors. Stop at that intersection
    or at the corridor end.
  - At each stop determine which directions (north, east, south, west) are
    available and choose one using the order: left, straight, right, back.
  - Update position, corridor and direction accordingly.
  - Terminate when the starting point is reached again.
- Count total corridors minus the number of visited ones and print the
  remainder.

This simulation runs within the limits because each step inspects at most
500 perpendicular corridors and the explorer visits only a limited number of
segments.
