## Problem Summary
Given a font consisting of `n` symbols each drawn on an `r x c` grid using `o` for pixels and `.` for empty cells, decide whether every symbol can be uniquely identified by highlighting at most two of its pixels. A highlighted pixel must be one of the symbol's existing `o` cells and no two symbols may share the same set of highlighted positions. If it is possible, output the font with the identifying pixels replaced by `#` using the topmost-leftmost rule to choose among multiple valid options; otherwise output `impossible`.

## Algorithm
1. Read `n`, `r`, `c` and the `r` rows describing all symbols.
2. Count, for each grid position `(i,j)`, in how many symbols the cell contains an `o`.
3. For each symbol:
   - Collect all its `o` positions.
   - If any position is unique across symbols (count is 1), choose the topmost-leftmost such pixel.
   - Otherwise, consider all unordered pairs of its `o` positions and find the lexicographically smallest pair such that no other symbol has `o` in both positions simultaneously.
   - If neither a unique single pixel nor a unique pair exists, the test case is impossible.
4. If all symbols are identifiable:
   - Replace the chosen pixels with `#` in their corresponding grids.
   - Output the modified font, separating symbols with spaces.

The search per symbol examines at most `O(k^2 * n)` combinations where `k` is the number of pixels in the symbol (`k ≤ r*c ≤ 790`). This is efficient for the given limits.
