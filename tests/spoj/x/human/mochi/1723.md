# [Bee Maja](https://www.spoj.com/problems/BMJ/)

To convert Willi's spiral numbering of honey combs into Maja's axial grid coordinates we
observe that cells are arranged in hexagonal rings around the center.

For ring `r` (with `r = 0` being the center) the largest number is `1 + 3*r*(r+1)` and
its first cell is at `(0, r)`. Each ring has six sides of length `r` traversed in the
following order:

```
(-1,0) -> (0,-1) -> (1,-1) -> (1,0) -> (0,1) -> (-1,1)
```

Algorithm:

1. For each number `n` find the minimal ring `r` such that `n <= 1 + 3*r*(r+1)`.
2. Compute the index within the ring: `offset = n - (3*(r-1)*r + 2)`; starting point is
   `(0, r)`.
3. Walk along the six directions above, moving `min(offset, r)` steps for each side until
the offset is exhausted.
4. The resulting `(x, y)` is Maja's coordinate for `n`.

The complexity is `O(r)` per query where `r` is roughly `sqrt(n)` (for `n < 100000`,
`r <= 182`).
