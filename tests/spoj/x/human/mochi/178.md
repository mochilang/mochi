## Problem Summary
Given the matrix of shortest path distances between every pair of towns, two towns are considered neighbouring if there is no third town lying on a shortest path between them. For each test case we must output all such neighbouring pairs in increasing order.

## Algorithm
1. Read `n` and the `n x n` matrix `d`.
2. For each pair of towns `(i, j)` with `i < j`:
   - Check every other town `k`.
   - If `d[i][j] == d[i][k] + d[k][j]` for some `k`, then `k` lies on a shortest path and `(i, j)` is not neighbouring.
   - Otherwise, record `(i+1, j+1)`.
3. Output all recorded pairs. Separate test cases with a blank line.

The triple nested loop performs at most `n^3` comparisons with `n â‰¤ 200`, which is efficient for the given constraints.
