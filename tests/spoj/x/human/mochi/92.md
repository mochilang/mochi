# CUTSQRS - Cutting off Squares

At each move with rectangle sides `a <= b` the current player may cut off `k` squares of size `a` where `1 <= k <= floor(b/a)`. The
new rectangle has sides `(a, b - k*a)` (sorted) and turns pass to the opponent. The game ends when a player removes the last
piece.

A key observation is that the number of possible game sequences depends only on the sequence of quotients in Euclid's algorithm.
Let `b = q*a + r`. For this position the player has `q` choices. All positions reached after any choice share the same recursive
structure. The total number of sequences `N(a,b)` satisfies

```
N(a,b) = 2^{(q-1) + (q'-1) + ...}
```

where the sum runs over every step `(a,b) -> (r,a)` of Euclid's algorithm with quotient `q`. Thus `N(a,b)` is always a power of
two. The number of sequences where the starting player wins is half of that (except when `N=1`, where it is also `1`).

To determine whether the starting player can force a win, simulate the game using Euclid's rule: whenever `b % a == 0` or
`b/a >= 2` the current player can win immediately; otherwise the game continues with `(b % a, a)` and the roles swapped.

Finally, the number Michael writes down is

```
digits(N) + digits(N/2) + len(word)
```

where `len(word)` is `5` for "first" or `6` for "second".
