# SPOJ GALAXY - A Simple Calculator in the Galaxy

Problem: https://www.spoj.com/problems/GALAXY/

Given up to 99 expressions, each consists of two non‑negative integers
and an operator `+`, `-`, or `*`. The numbers may be very large, and the
result is always positive. We must evaluate each expression and output
the result without leading zeros.

## Algorithm
1. Read integer `T`.
2. For each of the `T` lines:
   - Skip leading spaces and parse the first number digit by digit.
   - Skip spaces, read the operator, then skip spaces again.
   - Parse the second number.
   - Compute `a + b`, `a - b`, or `a * b` depending on the operator
     using the language's arbitrary‑precision integers.
   - Output the resulting number.

Each line is processed in `O(L)` time where `L` is its length, and memory
usage is `O(1)` besides the parsed integers.
