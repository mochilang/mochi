## Problem Summary
For each test case with an integer **N** (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000), compute the expected number of throws of an N-sided fair die required so that every face appears at least once. Output the expectation rounded to two decimal digits.

## Algorithm
1. For each test case read N.
2. The expected number of throws to see all N faces is \(N \times (1 + 1/2 + \cdots + 1/N)\), the coupon collector formula.
3. Compute the harmonic sum by iterating i from 1 to N and accumulating \(N / i\).
4. Format the result to two decimal places and print it.

This runs in O(N) time per test case and uses O(1) additional space.
