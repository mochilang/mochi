# [Crime at Piccadilly Circus](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PICAD/)

## Problem Summary
Given an interval [p, k] and n people with presence intervals [ai, bi], determine the minimal and maximal number of people simultaneously at the crime scene at any time within [p, k]. Ten test cases are provided.

## Algorithm
1. For each person, intersect their interval with [p, k]. If the intersection [s, e] is non-empty, add two sweep-line events: +1 at s and -1 at e+1 (intervals are inclusive).
2. Insert neutral events at p and k+1 to cover gaps.
3. Sort all events by time.
4. Sweep through the events in order, accumulating the current count. For event times within [p, k], update the minimal and maximal counts.
5. Output the minimal and maximal counts for each test case.

The event sorting dominates with O(n log n) time while the sweep runs in linear time.
