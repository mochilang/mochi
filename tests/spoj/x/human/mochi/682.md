# [Pairs of Integers](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PAIRINT/)

## Problem Summary
Given an integer \(N\), list all pairs of integers \(X\) and \(Y\) such that \(X + Y = N\) and \(Y\) is obtained from \(X\) by deleting exactly one digit. The number \(X\) must have at least two digits and cannot start with zero, while \(Y\) has one digit fewer and may start with zero. Print the count of such pairs followed by the pairs themselves in increasing order of \(X\).

## Algorithm
1. Read the number of test cases and process each value of \(N\).
2. For every candidate \(X\) from 10 to \(N\):
   - Convert \(X\) to a string and remove each digit in turn to form a candidate string for \(Y\).
   - Convert this string to an integer and check whether \(X + Y = N\).
   - If the equality holds, record the pair keeping \(Y\) with its leading zeros.
3. Output the number of collected pairs and then print each pair as `X + Y = N`.

This approach checks at most \(O(N \cdot D)\) possibilities per test case, where \(D\) is the number of digits in \(N\).
