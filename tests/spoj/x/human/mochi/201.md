# [The Game of Polygons](https://www.spoj.com/problems/POLYGAME/)

## Problem Summary
Given a triangulation of a convex polygon with one special black triangle (the first given), two players take turns removing a triangle that lies on the boundary of the current polygon. The player who removes the black triangle wins. For each test case, determine if the starting player has a winning strategy.

## Algorithm
1. Each triangle is a node; triangles sharing an edge are connected. The triangulation forms a tree.
2. Build adjacency by hashing edges `(min(a,b), max(a,b))` and linking triangles that share an edge.
3. Compute the Sprague-Grundy number of the tree rooted at the black triangle:
   - For node `u`, recursively compute Grundy numbers of its children `v` (excluding the parent).
   - If `u` has no children, its Grundy number is `1`.
   - Otherwise, `grundy(u) = XOR over (grundy(v) + 1)` for all children.
4. The starting player wins iff `grundy(root) > 0`.

This mirrors the "green Hackenbush" evaluation for trees, where each branch contributes `grundy(child) + 1` to the root.

## Complexity
Let `m = n-2` be the number of triangles. Building the adjacency and computing Grundy numbers both take `O(m)` time and `O(m)` memory per test case.
