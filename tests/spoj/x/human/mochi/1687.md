# SPOJ LOGIC2 - Logic II

We must determine the guilty person among `M` suspects when exactly `N` of them always lie and the rest always tell the truth. Each statement is one of only five useful forms about guilt or the current weekday.

## Algorithm

* Parse names and statements. Ignore sentences that do not match the five allowed templates.
* For every candidate `g` (0 ≤ g < M) who might be guilty:
  * Enumerate every subset of `N` liars using a bit mask (there are at most \(\binom{11}{N}\) possibilities).
  * For each configuration:
    * Track possible weekdays as a bit mask initially containing all seven days.
    * Evaluate each “Today is X” statement. If the speaker is truthful, intersect the mask with day `X`; if the speaker is a liar, exclude day `X`. If the mask becomes empty the configuration is impossible.
    * Evaluate each guilt statement. Check whether it is true for `g` and compare it to the speaker’s liar/truth status. Any mismatch invalidates the configuration.
    * If all statements hold and at least one weekday remains, mark `g` as a feasible guilty person.
* After exploring all configurations, if no `g` is feasible output **Impossible**. If exactly one `g` is feasible output that name. Otherwise output **Cannot Determine**.

The search space is tiny because `M ≤ 11` and `P ≤ 30`, so brute force enumeration is fast.
