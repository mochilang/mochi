## Problem Summary
The cave is a DAG with chambers numbered 1..n in increasing depth. Corridors go from lower-numbered to higher-numbered chambers. Each speleologist must start from chamber 1 and end at chamber n using distinct outgoing corridor from 1 and distinct incoming corridor to n; other corridors may be shared. We need the maximum number of such speleologists.

## Algorithm
1. Let `L` be nodes directly reachable from chamber 1.
2. Let `R` be nodes that have a corridor directly to chamber n.
3. For each `u` in `L`, run BFS to mark reachable chambers. For every reachable `v` in `R`, add edge `u -> v` in a bipartite graph.
4. Compute maximum bipartite matching between `L` and `R` using depth-first augmenting paths. The matching size is the answer.

BFS handles reachability in `O(n+m)` per start, and matching is `O(L*R)` with the small (`n â‰¤ 200`) constraints.
