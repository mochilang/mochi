## Problem Summary
Given a directed graph with edges labeled `<`, `>` or `=`, assign integers to vertices so that each edge's relation holds. We must find the smallest non‑negative integer `k` such that every vertex receives a value in `[0, k]`, or report `NO` if impossible.

## Algorithm
1. Transform constraints into difference inequalities.
   - For edge `u < v` add constraint `x_v >= x_u + 1`.
   - For edge `u > v` add constraint `x_u >= x_v + 1`.
   - For edge `u = v` add both `x_v >= x_u` and `x_u >= x_v`.
2. Convert to shortest‑path form by negating variables (`y_i = -x_i`), giving inequalities `y_v <= y_u + w` with weights `w` in `{0, -1}`.
3. Add a super source connected to all vertices with weight `0` and run Bellman‑Ford on the `y` graph to detect negative cycles. A negative cycle corresponds to contradictory relations, so output `NO`.
4. If feasible, the shortest `y` values yield largest possible `x = -y`. The required `k` is `max(x) - min(x)` across all vertices.

This runs in `O(n*m)` for `n` vertices and `m` relations.
