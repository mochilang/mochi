# SPOJ POSTERS - Election Posters

Problem: https://www.spoj.com/problems/POSTERS/

On a wall divided into integer sections, each of `n` posters covers a
contiguous interval `[l_i, r_i]` and later posters may cover parts of
previous ones. After all posters are hung, we must count how many still
have at least one visible section.

## Algorithm
1. For each test case read all intervals and collect all endpoints `l_i`
   and `r_i + 1` (the latter allows treating intervals as half-open
   ranges).
2. Sort and deduplicate these coordinates to compress them.
3. Process posters in reverse order while maintaining a disjoint-set
   structure over the compressed coordinates. For a poster covering
   `[L, R)`:
   - Find the first uncovered index `u` using path compression.
   - While `u < R`, mark it as covered (`parent[u] = u + 1`) and repeat
     from `u`'s new representative.
   - If any index was newly covered, this poster contributes to the
     result.
4. Output the number of posters that covered at least one new index.

The DSU operations run in near constant time, so the complexity is
`O(m log m)` where `m` is the number of unique coordinates (at most
`2n`). Memory usage is `O(m)`.
