# [Sorting Bank Accounts](https://www.spoj.com/problems/SBANK/)

## Problem Summary
For each test case, up to 100,000 bank account strings are provided. Each account has a fixed format
(`cc bbbbbbbb xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx`) and may repeat. We must output the distinct account numbers in
ascending order and append the number of occurrences for each. An empty line separates the output of
consecutive test cases.

## Algorithm
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - Read `n` and collect the `n` account strings in a list.
   - Sort the list using a merge sort routine.
   - Scan the sorted list, counting consecutive equal strings and printing each account with its
     frequency.
   - Print a blank line between test cases and consume the blank line present in the input.

Sorting requires `O(n log n)` time and the final scan is linear, so the approach meets the problem's
constraints.
