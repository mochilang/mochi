# [4 values whose sum is 0](https://www.spoj.com/problems/SUMFOUR/)

## Problem Summary
Given four lists \(A,B,C,D\) of \(n\) integers (up to 2\^28 in absolute value),
count the number of quadruples \((a,b,c,d) \in A \times B \times C \times D\)
for which \(a+b+c+d = 0\). The size \(n\) is at most 2500.

## Algorithm
1. Read the four lists.
2. Compute all \(n^2\) pair sums `a+b` for `A` and `B` and store their frequencies in a hash map.
3. For every pair `c+d` from `C` and `D`, look up `-(c+d)` in the map and accumulate the stored frequency into the answer.
4. Output the total count of matching quadruples.

The hash map holds up to \(n^2\) entries and each lookup is constant time on average,
so the total runtime is \(O(n^2)\), which is feasible for \(n \le 2500\).
