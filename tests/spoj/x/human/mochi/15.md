# [Shortest Path (SHPATH)](https://www.spoj.com/problems/SHPATH/)

## Problem Summary
Given several city networks, each with positive-weight roads between cities, answer queries for the minimum transportation cost between two named cities.

## Algorithm
1. For each test case, map city names to indices and build an adjacency list of neighbors with edge costs.
2. To answer a query from `A` to `B`, apply Dijkstra's algorithm:
   - Initialize arrays for distances (set to a large value) and a visited flag for each city.
   - Repeatedly select the unvisited city with the smallest current distance.
   - Mark it visited and relax all outgoing edges, updating neighbor distances when a cheaper path is found.
   - Stop once the destination city is selected or all cities have been processed and output the destination's distance.

This implementation runs in `O(V^2)` time per query and uses `O(V+E)` memory for storing the graph and distances.
