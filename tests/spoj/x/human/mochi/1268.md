# [CN Tower (Easy)](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CNEASY/)

## Problem Summary
Given the compass angles of landmarks around CN Tower, determine the minimum time a rotating restaurant (360Â° every 72 minutes) must rotate to see all landmarks, starting at any angle. Output the ceiling of seconds required.

## Algorithm
1. Convert each landmark angle to integer hundredths of degrees.
2. Sort the angles and compute the largest gap between consecutive angles, including wrap-around.
3. The minimal rotation needed equals 36000 - maxGap hundredths of degrees.
4. Time in seconds = ceil(rotation * 12 / 100).
5. Output this time for each test case.

The algorithm sorts once and scans once, giving O(n log n) time and O(n) memory.
