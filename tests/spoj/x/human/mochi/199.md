# EMPTY - Empty Cuboids

We need the largest axis-aligned cuboid with one vertex at the origin and edges along the positive axes so that none of the given points lies in its interior. Coordinates are integers in `[1,10^6]`.

A point `(px, py, pz)` is inside a cuboid with opposite vertex `(X, Y, Z)` iff `px < X`, `py < Y` and `pz < Z`.  All optimal coordinates for `X`, `Y` and `Z` come from the set of point coordinates or the maximal limit `10^6`.

Algorithm:

1. Read all points and collect candidate values for `X`, `Y` and `Z` as the unique coordinates from the points plus `10^6`.
2. Enumerate all triples `(X, Y, Z)` from these candidate sets.
3. For each triple verify that no point satisfies `px < X`, `py < Y` and `pz < Z`.  If the triple is valid, compute its volume and keep the one with maximal volume.

Let `k` be the number of candidates for each coordinate (at most `n+1`).  The complexity is `O(k^3 * n)`, which is feasible for the small test cases included in this repository.
