# SPOJ EMPTY - Empty Cuboids

We must maximize the volume of a cuboid \((X,Y,Z)\) anchored at the origin with sides at most `10^6` and with no given point strictly inside. For any point `(a,b,c)` inside we would have `a < X`, `b < Y` and `c < Z`, so to avoid all points at least one coordinate must be not greater than the corresponding point coordinate.

The optimal lengths occur only at coordinates taken from the input or at `10^6`. For each candidate `X` (all distinct `x` values and `10^6`):

1. Consider all points with `x < X` and keep them sorted by their `y` coordinate.
2. Scan the `y` values in increasing order while maintaining the smallest `z` seen so far (`minZ`).
3. For each distinct `y`, the largest allowed `Z` is `minZ`. Compute the candidate volume `X * y * minZ` and keep the best triple. After the scan also check `Y = 10^6` with the current `minZ`.
4. Insert all points whose `x` equals the current `X` into the sorted list and proceed to the next candidate `X`.

The list of `(y,z)` pairs grows monotonically, insertion is linear, and every scan over the list is linear. With at most `n = 5000` points the overall complexity is `O(n^2)`.
