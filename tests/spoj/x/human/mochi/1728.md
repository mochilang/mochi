# [Common Permutation](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CPRMT/)

## Problem Summary
Given two lowercase strings `a` and `b`, find the longest string `x` such that some permutation of `x` is a subsequence of `a` and some permutation of `x` is a subsequence of `b`. If multiple strings qualify, output the alphabetically smallest one.

## Algorithm
1. Count the frequency of each letter `'a'` to `'z'` in `a`.
2. Count the frequency of each letter in `b`.
3. For every letter in alphabetical order, append it to the result the minimum of its two counts.
4. Print the constructed string for each pair of input lines.

This effectively computes the multiset intersection of characters and runs in linear time relative to the combined lengths of the two strings.
