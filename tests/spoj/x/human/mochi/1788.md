## Problem Summary
Given `k` fractions and a starting integer `N`, repeatedly multiply the current
integer by the first fraction in the list that keeps the result integral. The
process stops when no fraction yields an integer. From the produced sequence we
are only interested in the terms that are powers of two. For each test case the
first `m` powers of two are reported via their exponents.

## Algorithm
1. Parse `m`, the starting value `N`, the number of fractions `k` and the `k`
   numerator/denominator pairs.
2. Store the current value as a big integer. While fewer than `m` powers of two
   have been found:
   - If the current value is a power of two, record its exponent.
   - Scan the fractions in order and pick the first whose numerator times the
     current value is divisible by its denominator; update the current value.
   - If no fraction applies, the sequence ends.
3. Output the collected exponents separated by spaces.

Big integers are used to avoid overflow as values in the sequence can grow
quickly.
