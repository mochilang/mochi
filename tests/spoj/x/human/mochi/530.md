# DIV2 - Divisors 2

This problem asks for numbers \(N \in [1,10^6]\) such that:

* The number of divisors of \(N\) is greater than 3, and
* For every divisor \(M\) of \(N\), the divisor count \(d(M)\) divides \(d(N)\).

The key observation is that a number satisfies the second property **iff** it is square‑free and has at least two distinct prime factors.
If \(N\) is square‑free with \(k\) different primes then \(d(N)=2^k\). Any divisor \(M\) is formed by choosing a subset of these primes, so \(d(M)=2^t\) for some \(t\le k\), and thus \(d(M)\mid d(N)\).
If \(N\) contains any squared prime, there exists a divisor whose divisor count introduces a prime factor absent from \(d(N)\), violating the condition.

Therefore we scan all integers up to one million and keep those that are square‑free with at least two prime factors.
We generate primes once using the sieve of Eratosthenes and factor each number with those primes.
Every 108‑th valid \(N\) is printed.

Complexity is dominated by the sieve and factorization, giving an overall complexity around \(O(n \log n)\) for \(n=10^6\).
