# [Tic-Tac-Toe ( I )](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TOE1)

## Problem Summary
Given a 3x3 grid containing `X`, `O` and `.` characters, determine if it can
appear during a valid game of Tic-Tac-Toe. X always moves first and players
alternate placing their marks. A board is valid if it can occur at any point
from the start up to and including the end of a game.

## Algorithm
1. **Count Marks** – count the number of `X` and `O` on the board.
   A necessary condition is `countX == countO` or `countX == countO + 1`.
2. **Check Winners** – detect if `X` or `O` has a winning line (three in a row
   horizontally, vertically or diagonally).
3. **Validate**
   - Both players winning simultaneously is impossible.
   - If `X` wins, `countX` must be exactly one more than `countO`.
   - If `O` wins, counts must be equal.
   - If no one wins, counts must differ by at most one.
4. Output `"yes"` if all conditions hold, otherwise `"no"`.

This logic runs in constant time for each test case since the board is always 3x3.
