# [DEL Command II](https://www.spoj.com/problems/DELCOMM2/)

## Problem Summary
Given a list of file names each tagged with `+` to delete or `-` to keep, find the largest number of deletable files that can be removed using a single DOS `DEL` command with `?` and `*` wildcards. The wildcard must match only files marked for deletion and none of the protected files. File names and patterns are at most eight characters long and contain only letters or digits.

## Algorithm
1. Separate file names into positive (delete) and negative (keep) sets.
2. Generate candidate wildcard patterns from every pair of positive names:
   - Build a pattern from the longest common subsequence of the two names, inserting `*` for unmatched segments and `?` for single-character mismatches.
   - Build an alternative pattern using common prefixes and suffixes with `?` for equal-length differences.
   - Add the original file names themselves.
3. For each unique candidate pattern of length ≤ 8, count how many positive names it matches while ensuring it matches none of the negatives using DOS wildcard matching.
4. Output the maximum count across all valid patterns.

This enumeration over all pairs yields at most O(p²) patterns for p deletable files, and each pattern is tested against at most 250 names, which is efficient given the small limits.
