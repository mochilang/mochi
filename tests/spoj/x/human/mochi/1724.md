# SPOJ TRICOUNT - Counting Triangles

[https://www.spoj.com/problems/TRICOUNT/](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TRICOUNT/)

For a triangle of level `N`, the grid contains upright triangles of size `k` for `1 ≤ k ≤ N`.
The number of size `k` triangles equals `(N - k + 1) * (N - k + 2) / 2`.
Summing this formula over all `k` yields:

```
if N is even:
  total = N*(N + 2)*(2*N + 1) / 8
else:
  total = (N*(N + 2)*(2*N + 1) - 1) / 8
```

This computes the total number of triangles in `O(1)` time per test case.
