# [CPCRC1C - Sum of Digits](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CPCRC1C/)

For each pair of integers `a` and `b` read from standard input, compute the
sum of digits of every number between `a` and `b` inclusive. The input
terminates with the line `-1 -1`.

## Algorithm
1. Define a function `F(n)` that returns the sum of digits of all numbers
   from `0` to `n`.
   - Iterate over decimal positions with a factor `10^k`.
   - For each position, accumulate contributions from higher digits, the
     current digit, and the remainder.
2. For each query, output `F(b) - F(a-1)`.

`F(n)` runs in `O(log_{10} n)` time, so each query is processed in logarithmic
time with constant extra memory.
