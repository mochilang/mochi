# [Two squares or not two squares](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TWOSQRS/)

## Problem Summary
Given an integer `n` (`0 \le n \le 10^{12}`) for multiple test cases, determine whether it can be written as the sum of two integer squares.

## Algorithm
For a number to be expressible as a sum of two squares, every prime factor congruent to `3 (mod 4)` must occur with an even exponent. For each test case:

1. Factor `n` by trial division up to `sqrt(n)`.
2. Track the exponent of each factor `p`.
3. If `p % 4 == 3` and its exponent is odd, immediately output `No`.
4. After removing all factors, if the remaining value is congruent to `3 (mod 4)`, output `No`.
5. Otherwise output `Yes`.

This runs in `O(sqrt(n))` per test case, which is feasible for `n \le 10^{12}`.
