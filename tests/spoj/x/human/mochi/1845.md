# [Mice and Maze](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MICEMAZE/)

## Problem Summary
Given a directed graph of up to 100 cells representing a maze, each edge has a travel time and may be one-way.  Starting a mouse from every cell simultaneously, count how many mice can reach the exit cell within a time limit.

## Algorithm
1. Build a reversed adjacency list: for every edge `a b w` store `b -> a` with the same cost.  Reversing allows us to run a single search from the exit to all cells.
2. Run Dijkstra's algorithm from the exit cell on this reversed graph using a simple `O(n^2)` selection of the next closest node.
3. Count and output the number of cells whose distance is not greater than the time limit.

This approach computes the minimum escape time for all cells in `O(n^2 + m)` time, which is sufficient for `n â‰¤ 100`.
