## Problem Summary
Simulate a tiny text editor. Characters are read line by line until an empty line is encountered. For each line:
- `d` duplicates the current line contents.
- any other character is appended to the line.
After processing a line, output it. When an empty line is read, stop and output all previously built lines.

## Algorithm
1. Loop reading lines with `input()`.
2. If the line is empty, terminate the loop.
3. For each character in the line:
   - if it is `d`, set `res = res + res` to duplicate the current string;
   - otherwise append the character to `res`.
4. Print `res`.

Each line is processed in time proportional to the length of the produced line (at most 150 characters).
