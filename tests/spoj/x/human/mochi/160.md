# [Palindromic Sequences](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PALSEC/)

## Problem Summary
Given two sequences of words `X` and `Y` of length `n` (with `n \le 30`), choose for each position either `X[i]` or `Y[i]` to form a concatenated string. Count how many binary choice sequences yield a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

## Algorithm
We explore all `2^n` possible choice sequences using recursion. For each index we append either `X[i]` or `Y[i]` to an accumulator string. When all words are chosen, we test if the resulting string is a palindrome. Valid palindromes contribute one to the count.

## Complexity
Let `L` be the total length of concatenated words (at most about `12000`). The approach runs in `O(2^n * L)` time and uses `O(L)` additional space for the built string.
