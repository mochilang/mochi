## Problem Summary
Given two positive integers and an operator (`+`, `-`, or `*`), compute the result using manual calculation format. Numbers can have up to 500 digits. Addition and subtraction require the second number printed below the first with the operator in front. Multiplication additionally prints partial products for each digit of the second number aligned to the digit's place. Each expression is separated by a blank line.

## Algorithm
1. Parse each expression into operands `A`, `B` and operator `op`.
2. Perform big integer arithmetic using strings:
   - **Addition:** traverse digits from right to left, summing with carry.
   - **Subtraction:** assuming `A >= B`, subtract digits with borrow handling.
   - **Multiplication:** for each digit of `B` (right to left) compute `A * digit` producing partial strings. Sum shifted partials to form the final product.
3. Determine the output width as the maximum of `len(A)`, `len(B)+1`, `len(result)`, and lengths of partial products plus their shifts.
4. Print `A` right-aligned to width, then `op` with `B` right-aligned. Print a dashed line whose length covers the longer of `B`+operator or first partial result/result.
5. For multiplication with multi-digit `B`, print each partial product aligned so its last digit lines up with the corresponding digit of `B`, followed by another dashed line of length `len(result)`.
6. Finally, print the result right-aligned and a blank line after each test case.

This approach simulates grade-school arithmetic using string manipulation, meeting the formatting requirements for numbers up to 500 digits.
