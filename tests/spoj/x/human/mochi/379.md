# [Ambiguous Permutations](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PERMUT2/)

## Problem Summary
Given multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000)
followed by a permutation of `1..n`, determine whether the permutation is
ambiguous, i.e. equal to its inverse permutation.

## Algorithm
1. For each test case until `n = 0`:
   - Read the permutation `p` of size `n`.
   - Build its inverse `inv` where `inv[p[i] - 1] = i + 1`.
   - If for every `i` from `0` to `n-1` we have `inv[i] == p[i]`, the
     permutation equals its inverse and is **ambiguous**; otherwise it is
     **not ambiguous**.

The algorithm runs in `O(n)` time per test case with `O(n)` extra space for the
inverse permutation.
