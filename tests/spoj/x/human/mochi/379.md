## Algorithm

For each test case:

1. Read integer `n` and then a permutation `p[1..n]` of numbers 1..n.
2. Construct its inverse permutation `inv` by setting `inv[p[i]] = i` for all `i`.
3. Compare `p` and `inv`.  If every position `i` satisfies `p[i] = inv[i]`, the permutation is ambiguous.
4. Output `"ambiguous"` if they are equal, otherwise `"not ambiguous"`.

Building the inverse and comparing take `O(n)` time and `O(n)` additional space per test case.
