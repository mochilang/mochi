# [A Game with Numbers](https://www.spoj.com/problems/NGM/)

## Problem Summary
Two players alternately subtract any non-zero digit from the current number.
Starting from an integer less than 2,000,000,000, the player who first reaches
zero wins. Given the starting number, determine the winner assuming optimal
play and, when the first player wins, output a winning first move.

## Algorithm
- Any multiple of 10 is a losing position: all allowed subtractions lead to a
  number whose last digit is non-zero, giving the opponent a winning reply.
- If the starting number is not divisible by 10, subtract its last digit. The
  result is a multiple of 10, forcing the opponent into a losing state. Repeating
  this strategy eventually reaches zero.
- Therefore, if `n % 10 == 0`, output `2` (second player wins); otherwise output
  `1` and the digit `n % 10` as the winning first move.

This solution runs in constant time and memory.
