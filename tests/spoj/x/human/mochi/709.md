## Problem Summary
For each test case we are given `N` contestants and their rankings in three different competitions. A contestant A is better than contestant B if A ranks higher in all three contests. A contestant is considered *excellent* if no other contestant is better than them. The task is to count how many excellent contestants exist in each test case.

## Algorithm
1. Read all contestants as triples `(a, b, c)` for their ranks in the first, second and third contests.
2. For each contestant `i`, compare them with every other contestant `j`:
   - If there exists a contestant `j` such that `a_j < a_i`, `b_j < b_i` and `c_j < c_i`, then `i` is not excellent.
3. Count contestants for which no dominating contestant exists and output this count.

This straightforward comparison requires `O(N^2)` time per test case and `O(N)` additional space.
