# CSTREET - Cobbled streets

We are given several test cases. For each test case:
- `p`: price per unit length of paving.
- `n`: number of buildings.
- `m`: number of streets each connecting two buildings with length `c`.

We must pave a subset of streets so that all buildings are connected and the
total cost `p * sum(lengths)` is minimal.

## Algorithm
1. Read all values using a token-based scanner and build an adjacency list
   for the graph.
2. Apply **Prim's algorithm** starting from building `0`:
   - Maintain `dist[i]`, the cheapest edge connecting vertex `i` to the
     growing tree, and a `used` flag for each vertex.
   - Repeatedly choose the unused vertex with minimum `dist`, add its cost to
     the total, and relax all adjacent edges.
3. After processing all `n` vertices, multiply the total length by `p` and
   output the result.

With `n ≤ 1000` this `O(n^2 + m)` implementation easily fits within the
constraints (`m ≤ 300000`).
