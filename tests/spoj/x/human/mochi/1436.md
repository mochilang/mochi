# [Is it a tree](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PT07Y/)

## Problem Summary
Given an undirected graph with `N` nodes and `M` edges, determine whether the graph forms a tree topology. A tree is connected and has exactly `N-1` edges.

## Algorithm
1. Read `N` and `M`.
2. If `M` is not equal to `N-1`, output `NO` immediately.
3. Build an adjacency list for all edges.
4. Perform a breadth-first search starting from node `1` to count reachable nodes.
5. If all nodes are visited, print `YES`; otherwise, print `NO`.

This runs in `O(N + M)` time and uses `O(N + M)` space.
