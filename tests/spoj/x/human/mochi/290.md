# POLYEQ - Polynomial Equations

We are given a polynomial of degree at most 6 with integer coefficients.
All roots are real and lie within `[-100,100]`.
The task is to output every root (including multiplicity) to two decimal places.

## Algorithm

1. **Parsing**
   * Remove whitespace, convert every `-` to `+-` (except at start) and split by `+`.
   * For each term determine coefficient and degree, filling an array `a[0..6]`.

2. **Recursive root search**
   * For degree `1` solve directly, for `2` use quadratic formula.
   * For higher degrees:
     * Recursively find roots of the derivative. These roots divide the search interval
       into monotonic segments.
     * For each derivative root `r` where `F(r)=0`, append `r` with multiplicity
       equal to derivative multiplicity `+ 1`.
     * Add `-100` and `100` as bounding points and scan adjacent pairs.
       If the polynomial values at a pair have opposite signs, perform bisection
       to locate a root inside the interval.

3. **Output**
   * Sort all collected roots and print them rounded to two decimals.

The polynomial degree is at most six, so the recursion depth and number of
intervals are small. Bisection converges quickly because the root bounds are
narrowed each iteration.
