## Problem Summary
Given a line of up to 1000 uppercase letters, output the same letters arranged in non-descending order.

## Algorithm
1. Read the input line.
2. Split it into a list of single-character strings.
3. Sort the list using insertion sort, comparing characters lexicographically.
4. Join the sorted characters back into a string and print it.

This runs in O(n^2) time for n characters (n â‰¤ 1000) and uses O(n) additional space.
