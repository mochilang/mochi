# [The Bytelandian Cryptographer (Act II)](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CRYPTO2)

## Problem Summary
An enemy cryptographer encrypted a three-digit positive integer by subtracting one from it. Given the encrypted value, recover the original number.

## Algorithm
1. Read the encrypted integer `n`.
2. Output `n + 1` to decrypt it.

The computation is a single addition, running in constant time and space.
