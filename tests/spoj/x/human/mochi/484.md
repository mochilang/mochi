# [Fossil in the Ice](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TFOSS/)

## Problem Summary
For each test case we are given the coordinates of probes hitting a fossil. The goal is to find the square of the largest distance between any two probes, i.e., the squared diameter of the point set.

## Algorithm
1. **Convex Hull:** Only points on the convex hull can be part of the farthest pair. Build the hull of all probes using the monotone chain algorithm after sorting points by `x` then `y`.
2. **Rotating Calipers:** Traverse the convex hull with the rotatingâ€‘calipers technique to compute the largest squared distance between any two hull vertices.
3. Output this maximum squared distance for each test case.

The monotone chain runs in `O(n log n)` time due to sorting and `O(n)` for hull construction. The rotating calipers step is linear in the hull size, so the entire algorithm is `O(n log n)` per test case and uses `O(n)` extra memory.
