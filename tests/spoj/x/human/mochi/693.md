## Problem Summary
We have `2^N` enemy ships numbered `0` to `2^N-1`. They are bombed using the recursive strategy **BombStrat**:

1. Bomb the first half `[0, 2^{N-1}-1]` from left to right.
2. From the remaining half, bomb the last quarter `[2^{N-1}+2^{N-2}, 2^N-1]` in reverse order.
3. Recurse on the remaining quarter `[2^{N-1}, 2^{N-1}+2^{N-2}-1]`.

Given the binary identifier of a ship, output the 0-based index of the bomb that destroys it, also as a binary string of length `N`.

## Algorithm
We can transform the binary representation directly:

- If the ship number starts with `0`, its bombing index is unchanged.
- If it starts with `11`, the bombing index is `10` followed by the bitwise complement of the remaining bits.
- If it starts with `10`, the bombing index is `11` followed by the result of applying the same rules to the remaining bits.

The transformation is applied iteratively from left to right. Each step removes either 1 or 2 leading bits and appends the corresponding output fragment. The algorithm runs in `O(N)` time and uses `O(N)` space.
