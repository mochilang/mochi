# [Remove The String](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PSTRING/)

## Problem Summary
Given two strings `X` and `Y`, remove the minimal number of characters from `X` so that `Y` does not appear as a substring in the resulting string.

## Algorithm
1. **Prefix Function (KMP):** Compute prefix function for pattern `Y`.
2. **KMP Automaton:** Using the prefix function, determine the next state for any character (cached on demand).
3. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - `dp[j]` = minimal deletions needed after processing prefix of `X` and being in automaton state `j` (i.e., `j` characters of `Y` matched).
   - For each character of `X` and each state `j`:
     - Option 1: delete the character â†’ stay in state `j` with cost `dp[j] + 1`.
     - Option 2: keep the character, transition to state `k`. If `k` equals `|Y|`, skip (would form `Y`); otherwise update `dp[k]`.
4. Answer is minimum value in `dp` after processing all characters.

This algorithm runs in `O(|X| * |Y|)` time and `O(|Y|)` space.
