# [Phony Primes](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PHONY/)

## Problem Summary
For each line containing integers `Nmin` and `Nmax` with `1 ≤ Nmin < Nmax < 2^31` and `Nmax - Nmin < 10^6`, output every "phony prime" `N` in `[Nmin, Nmax]`. A phony prime is an odd, square-free composite with at least three distinct prime factors where for every prime factor `p`, `p - 1` divides `N - 1`. Input ends with `0 0`. If no such numbers exist for a range, print `none`.

## Algorithm
1. Precompute all primes up to `√(2^31) ≈ 46340` using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
2. For each test case:
   - Iterate `n` from `Nmin` to `Nmax`.
   - Skip even numbers.
   - Factor `n` using the precomputed primes, collecting distinct prime factors and ensuring no prime divides `n` more than once (square-free check).
   - Require at least three prime factors.
   - For each prime factor `p`, verify `(n - 1) % (p - 1) == 0` (Korselt's criterion).
   - If all tests pass, output `n`.
   - After processing the range, print `none` if no numbers were output.

The sieve runs once in `O(limit log log limit)` time. Factoring each number requires `O(√n)` in the worst case, which is efficient for the given range sizes.
