# [Help R2-D2!](https://www.spoj.com/problems/HELPR2D2/)

## Problem Summary
Simulate R2-D2's loading heuristic. Each starship has capacity `K` and containers arrive sequentially with given volumes. For each container, place it into the starship with the smallest index that can fit it. Lines beginning with `b` describe a block of containers (`b r v` meaning `r` containers of volume `v`). After processing all containers output the number of starships used and the total unused capacity.

## Algorithm
1. For each test case read `K` and the number of containers `n`.
2. Maintain a list `caps` of remaining capacity for each starship.
3. For every container volume `v` (expanding blocks as needed):
   - Iterate starship indices from `0` upward.
   - If the list ends, append a new starship with capacity `K`.
   - If starship `i` has at least `v` units free, place the container there (subtract `v`) and stop; otherwise continue to `i+1`.
4. After all containers are placed, let `s = len(caps)` and `w = sum(caps)`.
5. Output `s` and `w`.

This straightforward simulation runs in `O(s Â· n)` time in the worst case but is adequate for the given limits.
