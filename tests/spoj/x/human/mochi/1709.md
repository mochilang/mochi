## Problem Summary
For each photograph containing up to 1000 bright spots with integer coordinates,
find the maximum number of collinear points. If at least four points lie on a
single straight line, assume they correspond to train windows and report how
many points to eliminate; otherwise output zero. The input ends with `0`.

## Algorithm
1. For each point treat it as an anchor and compute slopes to all subsequent
   points.
2. Normalize every slope as a reduced pair `(dy, dx)` using the greatest common
   divisor and fix the sign so that identical slopes share the same string key.
   Collect all keys for the anchor and sort them.
3. Scan the sorted list to find the longest run of identical slopes. The length
   of this run plus one (for the anchor) is the number of collinear points.
4. Track the global maximum over all anchors and output it if it is at least
   four; otherwise output `0`.

This approach runs in `O(n^2 log n)` time per photograph which is feasible for
`n â‰¤ 1000` and uses `O(n)` additional space per anchor.
