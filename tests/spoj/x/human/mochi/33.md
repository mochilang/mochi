# SPOJ TRIP - Trip

Problem: https://www.spoj.com/problems/TRIP/

We are given two strings (each at most 80 characters) representing the city lists of Alice and Bob.
The goal is to print **all distinct longest common subsequences (LCS)** of the two strings in
lexicographic order. There is at least one valid subsequence and at most 1000.

## Algorithm
1. Build an `(n+1) x (m+1)` DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` stores the length of the LCS of
   `a[i:]` and `b[j:]`.
2. Traverse the table using a queue of states `(i, j, s)` where `s` is the prefix built so far.
   Only moves that keep the LCS length optimal are enqueued:
   - If characters match, advance both indices and append the character to `s`.
   - Otherwise, follow any directions whose `dp` value equals `dp[i][j]`.
   When either string ends and `s` reaches maximal length, record it if unseen.
3. Sort the collected strings and print them in lexicographic order, inserting a blank line
   between test cases.

The DP table computation runs in `O(n*m)` and the traversal explores at most the number of LCS
strings (`â‰¤1000`). Sorting the results takes `O(k log k)` for `k` sequences.
