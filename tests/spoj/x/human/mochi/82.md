## Problem Summary
Given a submission log of an ACM-style programming contest, compute for each problem A..I:
- the number of teams that solved it,
- the average number of submissions made by those teams,
- the average time of accepted submissions.
Times are in seconds from contest start. After a team solves a problem, further submissions for that problem are ignored. Averages are printed with two decimal places.

## Algorithm
1. Assign each team an index upon first encounter (up to 62 teams).
2. Maintain two 62×9 matrices:
   - `subs[i][p]` – number of submissions team `i` made on problem `p`.
   - `solved[i][p]` – whether team `i` already solved problem `p`.
   Track per-problem totals: solved count, total submissions and total time.
3. For each submission in order:
   - Look up the team index and problem index.
   - If `solved[i][p]` is true, ignore the submission.
   - Otherwise increment `subs[i][p]`.
   - If the result is accepted, mark `solved[i][p]` and update the totals with `subs[i][p]` and the submission time.
4. After all submissions, for each problem A..I:
   - If it was solved by at least one team, output the count and the averages (total submissions/time divided by solved count) rounded to two decimals.
   - Otherwise output the problem letter followed by `0`.

This approach runs in \(O(n)\) time for \(n\) submissions.
