## Problem Summary
Given a rectangular marble slab of size `W × H`, and a set of desired plate sizes `(Wi, Hi)` that cannot be rotated, cut the slab using only full horizontal or vertical cuts to produce plates of the desired sizes. Determine the minimum total area of the original slab that must remain unused (wasted).

## Algorithm
1. Pre-mark every allowed plate size so that a rectangle of that exact size can yield its entire area.
2. Use dynamic programming over all dimensions up to `W` and `H`.
   - `dp[w][h]` stores the maximum usable area obtainable from a `w × h` rectangle.
   - If `(w, h)` is a desired size, then `dp[w][h] = w * h`.
   - Otherwise, try every vertical cut `k` and horizontal cut `l` and maximize `dp[w][h]` over
     `dp[k][h] + dp[w-k][h]` and `dp[w][l] + dp[w][h-l]`.
3. After filling the table, the wasted area is `W * H - dp[W][H]`.

This approach runs in `O(W * H * (W + H))` time and uses `O(W * H)` space.
