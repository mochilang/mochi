## Problem Summary
Given a grid of size `R x C` with walls (`#`) and free cells (`.`). The free cells form a tree. Find the maximum number of blocks on the path between any two free cells.

## Algorithm
1. Locate any free cell and run breadth‑first search (BFS) to compute distances to all reachable cells. The farthest cell `A` from the starting cell lies on the tree's diameter.
2. Run BFS again starting from `A` to find the farthest distance `D` to another cell `B`.
3. Output `D` as the maximum rope length.

The BFS uses a queue over grid coordinates and a `dist` array initialized to `-1`. For each popped cell, examine its four neighbours (up, down, left, right) and enqueue unvisited free cells with distance `d+1`.

This double‑BFS computes the tree diameter in `O(R*C)` time and `O(R*C)` memory.
