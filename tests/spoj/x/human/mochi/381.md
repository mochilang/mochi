## Problem Summary
Given up to 100 intersections and bidirectional streets with associated success probabilities, determine the route from intersec
 tion 1 to intersection n that maximizes the chance of not being caught. Output the overall probability of this safest path as a percentage with six decimal places.

## Algorithm
1. Build an adjacency matrix storing the probability for each street in percent.
2. Maintain an array `dist` with the best success probability found so far to each node, starting with `dist[1] = 1` (100%).
3. Repeatedly select the unvisited node with the highest probability.
4. For each of its neighbors, compute `new = dist[u] * p/100`. If `new` exceeds the stored value, update the neighbor.
5. After processing all nodes, the answer is `dist[n] * 100` formatted with six digits after the decimal point.

This is essentially Dijkstra's algorithm using multiplication instead of addition. It runs in O(n^2) time and uses O(n^2) space for the adjacency matrix.
