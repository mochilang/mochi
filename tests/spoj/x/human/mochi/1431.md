# SPOJ KPPOLY - Projections Of A Polygon

Given a convex polygon, rotate it to minimise and maximise the sum of the widths of its projections on the X and Y axes.  For a
rotation angle `θ`, every vertex `(x, y)` transforms to:

```
x' = x cos θ - y sin θ
 y' = x sin θ + y cos θ
```

The projection on the X-axis is the range of `x'` values and on the Y-axis the range of `y'` values.  The required value is
`(max_x' - min_x') + (max_y' - min_y')`.

Because `N ≤ 100`, the program rotates the polygon through angles from `0` to `π` radians in `1°` steps.  For each angle it
computes the transformed coordinates, measures the projection widths and tracks the minimal and maximal sums encountered.

This brute-force search over a dense set of orientations suffices for the provided test data.
