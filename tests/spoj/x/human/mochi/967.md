## Problem Summary
Given `n` parking slots and `n` starships arriving in order, each starship picks a favorite slot `Pi`. If the slot is free it parks there; otherwise it moves to the next free slot to the right. If no slot is free it leaves. Count how many sequences `Pi` allow all starships to park, and output the answer modulo `10007`.

## Algorithm
The number of valid preference sequences for `n` slots equals the number of parking functions: `(n+1)^(n-1)`.

For each test case:
1. Let `base = n + 1` and `exp = n - 1`.
2. Compute `base^exp mod 10007` using fast exponentiation by squaring.
3. Print the result.

The computation runs in `O(log n)` time per test case.
