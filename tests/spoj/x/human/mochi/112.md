## Algorithm

We are given `n` vertical segments.  Two segments are horizontally visible when
their vertical ranges overlap and no segment strictly between them intercepts
that overlapping portion.  A triangle is a triple of segments that are pairwise
horizontally visible.

1. Read all segments and sort them by their `x` coordinate.
2. For `visible(i, j)` with `i < j`:
   - Compute `low = max(y1[i], y1[j])` and `high = min(y2[i], y2[j])`.
   - If `low > high`, the segments never meet vertically.
   - If `low == high`, ensure no segment between `i` and `j` covers that
     level; otherwise they are visible at that point.
   - If `low < high`, start at `y = low` and scan segments between them.
     Whenever a segment covers `y`, jump `y` to its top.  After processing,
     the pair is visible iff `y < high` (there is uncovered height left).
3. Enumerate all triples `i < j < k`.  If every pair in the triple is
   `visible`, increase the answer.
4. Print the count for each dataset.

## Complexity

Checking visibility of a pair costs `O(n)` in the worst case.  Enumerating all
triples yields `O(n^3)` time overall and `O(1)` extra memory.
