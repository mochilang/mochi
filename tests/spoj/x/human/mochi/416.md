# [Divisibility by 15](https://www.spoj.com/problems/DIV15/)

## Problem Summary
Given a string of decimal digits, build the largest possible number divisible by 15 using each digit at most once. If no such number exists, output `impossible`.

## Algorithm
1. Count the frequency of each digit and compute the total sum of digits.
2. Consider using `5` and `0` as the final digit (in that order).
   - If the chosen last digit is present, reserve one occurrence of it.
   - Let `r = sum % 3`. To make the sum divisible by 3:
     - If `r == 1`, remove the smallest digit with remainder `1` (digits `1,4,7`); otherwise remove two smallest digits with remainder `2` (digits `2,5,8`).
     - If `r == 2`, remove the smallest digit with remainder `2`; otherwise remove two smallest digits with remainder `1`.
   - Arrange the remaining digits in descending order and append the reserved last digit. Strip leading zeros.
3. Among the candidates for last digit, keep the numerically largest result.
4. If no candidate yields a number, print `impossible`.

This approach works in linear time over the digits and uses constant extra space.
