## Problem Summary
Given an initial amount `P` in dollars and cents, an annual interest rate `I` with two decimal digits, and a number of compounding intervals `C` per year, compute the value of the investment after one year. At the end of each interval, interest earned is added to the principal, but any fraction of a cent is discarded. Input terminates with `0.00 0.00 0`.

## Algorithm
1. **Parse values**:
   - Convert `P` to integer cents.
   - Convert `I` to an integer representing hundredths of a percent.
   - `C` is an integer.
2. **Compound `C` times**:
   - For each interval, compute `interest = (principal * I) // (10000 * C)` where `principal` and `interest` are in cents. This mimics discarding fractions of a cent.
   - Add `interest` to `principal`.
3. **Format result** in dollars with two decimals and output according to the required sentence.

The loop uses only integer arithmetic, avoiding floating-point errors while following the problem's rounding rule.
