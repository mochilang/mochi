# SPOJ MINCOUNT - Move To Invert

We have a triangle of coins of height `h` (row `i` has `i` coins). To invert it we need to move the minimum number of coins so that the triangle points downward.

If we overlay the inverted triangle onto the original one, shifting it vertically by `k` rows, the coins that already coincide do not need to be moved. The best shift is `k = floor((h-1)/3)` which maximizes the overlap. The number of moves is total coins minus the overlap:

- Let `k = (h - 1) // 3`.
- Let `base = 3*k*(k+1)/2` (overlap when remainder is `1`).
- If `h % 3 == 1` then `moves = base`.
- If `h % 3 == 2` then `moves = base + (k+1)`.
- If `h % 3 == 0` then `moves = base + 2*(k+1)`.

This handles `h = 0` separately with answer `0`.

The formulas are derived by counting the number of coins that overlap for each case (`h = 3k+1`, `3k+2`, `3k+3`). The computation uses only integer arithmetic and works for `0 \le h < 10^{10}`.
