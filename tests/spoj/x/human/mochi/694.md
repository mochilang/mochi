# [Distinct Substrings](https://www.spoj.com/problems/DISUBSTR/)

## Problem Summary
For each provided string, count how many distinct substrings it contains.

## Algorithm
1. For a string `s` of length `n`, create a list of all suffix starting positions `0..n-1`.
2. Sort these indices lexicographically by comparing the corresponding suffixes (bubble sort suffices for `n ≤ 1000`).
3. The total number of substrings is `n*(n+1)/2`.
4. Compute the longest common prefix (LCP) between each pair of adjacent sorted suffixes and subtract the sum of all LCPs from the total.
5. The result is the count of distinct substrings.

This approach runs in `O(n^2)` time and `O(n)` extra space per string, which is acceptable for `n ≤ 1000`.
