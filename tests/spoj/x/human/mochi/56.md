## Problem Summary
Given a binary string describing how a rope is recursively cut in half, determine how many cuts are needed until the first occurrence of the shortest final piece. A `1` means the current piece is cut into two halves and is followed by the instructions for the left piece and then the right piece. A `0` means the piece is not cut further. Cutting always processes the left side before the right side.

## Algorithm
1. Traverse the instruction string in pre-order using a stack of depths. Start with depth 0 for the entire rope.
2. Pop a depth and read the next character:
   - If it is `1`, increment the cut counter and push `depth+1` twice (right then left) so the left piece is processed first.
   - If it is `0`, the piece is final. If its depth is greater than any seen so far, record this depth and the current cut counter.
3. After traversing all characters, the recorded cut counter equals the number of cuts made before the first shortest piece was obtained.

This simulation visits each character once and uses a stack proportional to the depth of recursion.

## Complexity
- Time: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the instruction string.
- Space: `O(h)` where `h` is the maximum depth of cuts.
