# TETRIS3D - Tetris 3D

[SPOJ problem link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TETRIS3D/)

## Algorithm

- Initialize a `D × S` grid of heights with zeros.
- For each incoming block described by `(d, s, w, x, y)`:
  - Scan all cells covered by the block's footprint `[x, x+d) × [y, y+s)` to find the maximum current height `h`.
  - The block settles at height `h + w`; assign this value to every cell in the footprint.
  - Track the overall maximum height seen so far.
- After processing all blocks, output the recorded maximum.

## Complexity

Let `d` and `s` be the block's dimensions. Each block requires `O(d · s)` time to scan and update its region. In the worst case the total running time is `O(N · D · S)` and the memory usage is `O(D · S)`.
