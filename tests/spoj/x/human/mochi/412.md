# SPOJ COVER - K-path cover

Split each original vertex into a left and a right copy.  For every directed edge \(u \to v\), add an edge from left\(u\) to right\(v\) with cost equal to the sum of costs of \(u\) and \(v\).  Connect a source to every left copy and every right copy to a sink with capacity one to ensure unique start and end vertices.

Running a min-cost max-flow algorithm from the source to the sink finds the cheapest set of edges satisfying the constraints.  We send exactly \(k\) units of flow; if less than \(k\) units can be pushed, no \(k\)-path cover exists.  We use SPFA to obtain shortest augmenting paths because edge costs may be negative.
