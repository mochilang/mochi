# [WORMS - Play with Digit Seven](https://www.spoj.com/problems/WORMS)

## Problem Summary
A positive integer is "good" if it is divisible by 7 or contains the digit 7.
Given an integer \(n\) (1 ≤ n ≤ 500), determine how many integers in the range
\([1,10^n]\) are good.

## Algorithm
1. Count numbers in \([0,10^n-1]\) that **do not** contain the digit 7 and are
   not divisible by 7 using digit DP.
2. Maintain a DP array of size 7 where `dp[r]` is the number of length-`i`
   sequences with remainder `r` modulo 7 and no digit 7.
3. For each of the `n` positions, update the DP for every remainder and digits
   0–9 except 7.
4. After processing all digits, sum `dp[1..6]` to get counts not divisible by 7;
   add 1 for the value `10^n` (which also lacks digit 7 and isn't divisible by 7).
5. Compute `10^n` with big integers and subtract the count of not-good numbers.

This DP runs in \(O(n \times 7 \times 9)\) time and uses big integers to
handle values up to \(10^{500}\).
