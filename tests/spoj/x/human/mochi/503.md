# [Prime Intervals](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PRINT/)

## Problem Summary
Given up to several queries with integers `m` and `n` where `1 \le m \le n \le 10^9` and `n - m \le 100000`, output all prime numbers in the inclusive range `[m, n]`. Each prime is printed on its own line and test cases are separated by an empty line.

## Algorithm
1. **Precompute small primes** up to `\sqrt{10^9} \approx 31623` using the classic Sieve of Eratosthenes.
2. For each query interval `[m, n]`:
   - Allocate a boolean array of size `n - m + 1` initialized to `true`.
   - For every precomputed prime `p` with `p^2 \le n`, mark multiples of `p` within the interval as composite. The first multiple to mark is `max(p^2, \lceil m/p \rceil \cdot p)`.
   - After marking, any index still `true` corresponds to a prime number `m + i`; ignore the value `1`.
3. **Output** all remaining numbers marked prime, in order, and print a blank line between test cases.

This segmented sieve runs in `O(n - m + 1)` space per query and `O((n-m+1) \log \log n)` time, which fits the problem limits.
