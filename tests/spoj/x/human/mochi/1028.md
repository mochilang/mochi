## Problem Summary
Given \(N\) numbered pieces and the starting player (0 for Airborne, 1 for Pagfloyd), two players alternately remove a chosen number and all of its divisors. Whoever removes the last piece wins. Determine the winner assuming optimal play.

## Algorithm
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read \(N\) and the starting player flag.
3. The starting player always has a winning strategy, so:
   - if the flag is `0`, print `"Airborne wins."`;
   - otherwise, print `"Pagfloyd wins."`.

## Correctness
Removing any number on the first move can never give the opponent a winning reply for all remaining cases; hence the initial player can always force a win. Therefore the winner is simply the starting player.

## Complexity Analysis
Processing each test case requires constant work, so the overall time complexity is \(O(t)\) for \(t\) test cases, with constant extra space.
