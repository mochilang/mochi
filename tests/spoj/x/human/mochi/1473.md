# LEMON - Lemon Tree in the Moonlight

We model the tree as a stack of frustums. For a frustum the radius varies linearly
with height and the shadow of a horizontal cross section is a disc shifted
h·cot(α) along the ground.

To approximate the shadow area we sample the height in small steps. For each
sampled level we know its radius and the horizontal position of its shadow's
centre. The shadow on the ground is the union of all these discs.

We then scan the horizontal axis in small steps. For every position we find the
largest vertical extent among all discs that cover it. The area is the integral
of these widths which we approximate by summing `2*y*dx` over all steps.

The result is printed with two decimal places.
