# [Cubes](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CUBES/)

## Problem Summary
List all integer quadruples `a, b, c, d` with `2 ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d < a ≤ 100` such that `a^3 = b^3 + c^3 + d^3`. Each solution must be printed as `Cube = a, Triple = (b,c,d)` in increasing order of `a` and, for equal `a`, in increasing `b` (and then `c`, `d`).

## Algorithm
1. Precompute the cubes of all numbers 0 through 100 in an array `cubes`.
2. For each `a` from 2 to 100:
   - Let `a3 = cubes[a]`.
   - For each `b` from 2 to `a-1`:
     - `b3 = cubes[b]`.
     - For each `c` from `b` to `a-1`:
       - `c3 = cubes[c]`.
       - For each `d` from `c` to `a-1`:
         - If `a3 == b3 + c3 + cubes[d]`, output the formatted line.

The nested loops perform at most about 25 million iterations, which easily fits within the limits. Precomputing cubes avoids repeated exponentiation.
