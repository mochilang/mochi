# BROUL - Babylonian Roulette

[Problem statement](https://www.spoj.com/problems/BROUL/)

## Algorithm

For each triplet `(P0, B, Pf)`:

1. If `P0 < B`, no one can spin the roulette because the pot is smaller than the bet. The triplet is valid only when `Pf = P0` (0 players), otherwise it is impossible.
2. Compute `diff = Pf - P0`. Each turn changes the pot by a multiple of `B`, so `diff` must be divisible by `B`; otherwise the record is invalid.
3. Let `m = |diff| / B` be the number of bet units by which the pot changed. In one turn the pot can change by at most three units (labels −3..3). Thus the minimal number of players is `ceil(m / 3)`.

## Correctness

- Step 1 handles the case when the game cannot start. If `P0 < B` and `Pf ≠ P0`, there is no sequence of plays that could change the pot.
- Step 2 is necessary because all moves add or subtract multiples of `B`. If `diff` is not divisible by `B`, no sequence of allowed moves reaches `Pf`.
- Step 3: Every turn changes the pot by at most three bet units. Using the largest possible change (±3) whenever possible minimizes the number of turns. The remaining difference (0, 1 or 2 units) requires one additional turn. This sequence is always feasible because the pot never becomes negative: when decreasing, a player can win at most the current pot. Therefore `ceil(m / 3)` turns are both sufficient and necessary.

## Complexity Analysis

Processing each test case performs only a few arithmetic operations, giving `O(1)` time and `O(1)` memory per case.
