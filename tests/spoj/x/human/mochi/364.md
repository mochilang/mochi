## Problem Summary
Given an expression with single-digit numbers separated by '+' or '*', compute two values for each test case:
- the maximum result achievable by inserting parentheses;
- the minimum result achievable.

There are up to 5000 test cases and each expression has fewer than 100 characters.

## Algorithm
- **Maximum value (Lisa)**: treat addition as higher precedence than multiplication. Split the expression on '*', sum the digits within each segment, then multiply the segment sums.
- **Minimum value (Tomm)**: treat multiplication as higher precedence. Split the expression on '+', multiply digits within each segment, then add the segment products.

Each pass over the expression is linear in its length, yielding overall \(O(n)\) time per test case.
