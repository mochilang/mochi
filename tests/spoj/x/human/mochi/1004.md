# SPOJ POLYCODE - Polygon Encoder

Given a natural number encoding a polygon via Cantor's pairing:

1. The list of vertices is encoded as `P2(n, Pn(v1..vn))` where each
   vertex `(x_i,y_i)` becomes `vi = P2(x_i, y_i)`.
2. To decode, repeatedly apply the inverse Cantor pairing function.
   For a number `z` the inverse returns `x` and `y` such that
   `z = (x+y)(x+y+1)/2 + y`.
   Unpair once to get the number of vertices `n` and the tuple value,
   then unpair `n-1` more times to recover every `vi`, and finally
   unpair each `vi` to obtain `(x_i,y_i)`.
3. Compute twice the signed area with the shoelace formula
   `sum(x_i*y_{i+1} - x_{i+1}*y_i)` over cyclic indices and take the
   absolute value.  The true area is this sum divided by two.
4. Output the area with one decimal place.  Since integer coordinates
   give half-integer areas, this is either `.0` or `.5`.

The decoding uses only arithmetic and loops, so the overall complexity
is linear in the number of vertices.
