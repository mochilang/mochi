# BENEFACT - The Benefactor

[Problem link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/BENEFACT/)

The city is modeled as a tree where each edge represents a street with a length. The task is to find the longest possible distance between any two nodes in the tree (the diameter).

## Algorithm

1. Build an adjacency list of the tree with edge lengths.
2. Run a BFS/DFS from an arbitrary node (node 1) to find the farthest node `A`.
3. Run another BFS/DFS starting from `A` to compute distances to all nodes and obtain the maximum distance `D`.
4. Output `D`, which is the length of the longest street.

This works because in a tree the farthest node from any starting node is one end of the diameter, and the farthest node from that end gives the diameter length. The complexity is O(n) per test case.
