## Problem Summary
Convert numbers between bases 2 through 16. For each input line the first token is the number, the second the source base and the third the target base. The calculator's display holds at most seven characters; if the converted representation exceeds this length, output `ERROR`. Results must be right‑justified within the seven‑character display.

## Algorithm
1. Read lines until EOF and split each line by whitespace into three fields: `num`, `from`, and `to`.
2. Convert `num` from base `from` to an integer by processing each character and accumulating `value = value * from + digit`.
3. Convert the integer to base `to` using repeated division, collecting remainders and mapping them to digits `0`-`9`/`A`-`F`.
4. If the resulting string's length exceeds seven, print `ERROR`; otherwise, print the string padded on the left with spaces to fill the seven‑character display.

This approach performs linear work in the length of each number and supports all required bases.
