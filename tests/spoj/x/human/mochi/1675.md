## Problem Summary
Inside an $N \times N \times N$ cube there are $K$ sources that can shoot an electron in one of the six axis-aligned directions.  All electrons start simultaneously and move at speed $1$.  Whenever two electrons collide they simply exchange directions: head-on collisions reverse both particles while perpendicular collisions swap their axes.  We want to choose the initial directions to maximize the time until any electron touches the boundary of the cube.

## Algorithm
- Because collisions between identical electrons only exchange their velocities, the system is equivalent to the electrons passing straight through each other if we ignore their identities.
- Therefore the earliest time a boundary is hit is determined solely by the individual distances that each electron must travel to reach a wall in its chosen direction.
- For a source at position $(x,y,z)$ the farthest it can be from any face is `max(x, y, z, N-x, N-y, N-z)`.  Orienting the electron toward that farthest face maximizes its own lifetime.
- The best overall strategy orients every electron toward its farthest face; the experiment ends when the closest of these travel times is reached.
- Thus the answer is the minimum over sources of the above maximal distances.

### Complexity
For each test case we inspect all $K$ sources once, giving $O(K)$ time and $O(1)$ additional memory.
