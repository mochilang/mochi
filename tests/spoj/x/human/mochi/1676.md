## Problem Summary
Given `N` known words (up to 10, each of length at most 6) and an integer `L` (up to 1,000,000), count how many uppercase strings of length `L` contain at least one of the known words as a substring. The answer is required modulo 10007. Input consists of multiple test cases ending at EOF.

## Algorithm
1. Build an Ahoâ€“Corasick automaton from the given words. Each node represents a prefix and tracks failure links and whether any word ends there.
2. Use dynamic programming over automaton states to count strings of length `L` that avoid all words:
   - `dp[state]` holds the number of ways to reach a non-terminal state after processing a prefix.
   - For each step, transition along all 26 letters, skipping states marked as terminal.
3. Compute `total = 26^L mod 10007` and `avoid = sum(dp[state])` after `L` steps. The desired count is `(total - avoid) mod 10007`.

This runs in `O(26 * states * L)` time with at most about 60 states and uses `O(states)` space.
