# [Making Labels](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MKLABELS/)

## Problem Summary
For each given \(N\) (1 \le N \le 10\), compute how many distinct labeled trees exist with vertex labels 1..N. Input consists of multiple values of \(N\) terminated by 0. Output the case number, \(N\), and the number of labelings.

## Algorithm
1. Read integers until 0.
2. For each \(N\):
   - If \(N \le 1\), result is 1.
   - Otherwise compute \(N^{N-2}\) using repeated multiplication.
3. Print `Case i, N = N, # of different labelings = result`.

By Cayley's formula, a tree with \(N\) labeled vertices has \(N^{N-2}\) labelings. Given \(N \le 10\), simple loops suffice.
