# [Build the Fence](https://www.spoj.com/problems/BSHEEP/)

## Problem Summary
Given the positions of many sheep, construct the shortest fence that encloses all of them. Sheep sharing the same coordinates are treated as one and only the earliest occurrence retains its index. For each test case output the perimeter of this fence and the indices of the sheep located at the fence corners starting from the bottom-most, left-most point and proceeding counter-clockwise.

## Algorithm
1. Read all points, discarding duplicates while remembering the first index of each unique coordinate.
2. Sort the remaining points by `x` then `y`.
3. Build the convex hull with the monotone chain method:
   - Scan left to right to build the lower hull using cross-product orientation checks.
   - Scan right to left to build the upper hull.
   - Concatenate the two parts, skipping duplicated endpoints.
4. Rotate the hull so that it starts from the bottom-most and left-most point.
5. Compute the perimeter by summing Euclidean distances of consecutive hull vertices, including the closing edge.
6. Print the perimeter rounded to two decimals and the indices in hull order.

The algorithm runs in `O(m log m)` time for `m` distinct points.
