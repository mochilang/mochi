# JEWELS - Jewelry and Fashion

We cut the string at every possible position. For each cut we compare the left and right parts.
To form a pair of earrings we can delete characters while preserving order, so we look for the
longest common subsequence (LCS) between the two halves. The right half may also be reversed,
representing rotating one earring by 180 degrees. The best pair length is twice the LCS length.

For each cut:
1. Compute LCS(left, right).
2. Compute LCS(left, reverse(right)).
3. Keep the larger of the two values and remember the smallest cut that achieves the maximum.

The sample input uses short strings so a straightforward dynamic programming LCS is fast enough.
