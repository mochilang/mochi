## Problem Summary
Given `N` nephews and `D` distinct CDs, count the number of possible distributions of the CDs where each nephew may receive any number of CDs (including zero). Input ends with `0 0`.

## Algorithm
Each CD can be given to any of the `N` nephews independently. Therefore the number of distributions equals `N^D`.

To handle very large results, compute `N^D` using fast exponentiation on arbitrary-precision integers:
1. Initialize `result = 1` and `base = N`.
2. While `D > 0`:
   - If `D` is odd, multiply `result` by `base`.
   - Square `base` and divide `D` by 2 (integer division).
3. Output `result`.

The loop runs in `O(log D)` multiplications and supports outputs with thousands of digits.
