## Problem Summary
Given multiple test cases, each with integers `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000) and `D` (0 ≤ D ≤ 2500) representing the number of nephews and distinct CDs, compute how many ways the CDs can be distributed among the nephews. A nephew may receive zero CDs. The input ends with `0 0`.

## Algorithm
Each CD is unique and can be given to any nephew independently. Therefore, the total number of distributions equals `N^D`.

For each test case:
1. Convert `N` to a big integer.
2. Multiply it by itself `D` times to compute `N^D`.
3. Output the result.

We use arbitrary-precision integers to handle the enormous results. Complexity is `O(D)` big-integer multiplications per test case.
