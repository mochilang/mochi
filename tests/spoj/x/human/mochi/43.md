## Problem Summary
Given m books each with a number of pages p1..pm, distribute them to k scribes (k â‰¤ m) such that every scriber receives a contiguous sequence of books and the maximum pages assigned to any scriber is minimized. Output the sequence with slashes separating the k parts. Among optimal solutions, prefer the one with minimal work for the first scriber, then second, etc., and ensure each scriber gets at least one book.

## Algorithm
1. Binary search on the answer between the largest single book and the total number of pages.
2. For each candidate limit, greedily scan the books counting how many scribers are required if none may exceed the limit.
3. After finding the minimal feasible limit, reconstruct the assignment from the end: start a new scriber whenever adding the next book would exceed the limit or when the remaining books equal the remaining scribers.
4. Print the books inserting ` / ` after partition points.

This runs in O(m log S) time per test case and uses O(m) additional space for the partition markers, where S is the sum of pages.
