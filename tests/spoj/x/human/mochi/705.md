# [Distinct Substrings](https://www.spoj.com/problems/DISUBSTR/)

## Problem Summary
Given up to 20 test cases, each containing a string of length at most 50\,000, determine how many distinct substrings the string has.

## Algorithm
1. Build a **suffix automaton** for the string.
2. Start with a single root state representing the empty string. For each character:
   - Create a new state for substrings ending at that character and link new transitions from previous suffixes.
   - If existing transitions would violate the automaton's invariant, clone the target state and redirect suffix links accordingly.
3. After processing all characters, every distinct substring corresponds to a path in the automaton. The total number is
   the sum over all states of `len[state] - len[link[state]]`.

The automaton has at most `2 * n` states and is built incrementally in linear time.

## Complexity
For a string of length `n`, construction and counting run in `O(n)` time using `O(n)` memory.
