# [Use of Function Arctan](https://www.spoj.com/problems/ARCTAN/)

## Problem Summary
Given an integer \(A\) (1 ≤ A ≤ 60000), find the minimum value of \(B+C\) over positive integers \(B, C\) satisfying:
\[\arctan(1/A) = \arctan(1/B) + \arctan(1/C).\]
Multiple test cases are provided.

## Algorithm
1. Use the tangent addition formula: 
   \[\tan(\alpha + \beta) = \frac{\tan \alpha + \tan \beta}{1 - \tan \alpha \tan \beta}.\]
   Setting \(\tan \alpha = 1/B\) and \(\tan \beta = 1/C\) and equating with \(\tan \gamma = 1/A\) gives:
   \[\frac{B+C}{BC-1} = \frac{1}{A} \Rightarrow (B-A)(C-A) = A^2 + 1.\]
2. Let \(N = A^2 + 1\). Write \(x = B-A\) and \(y = C-A\). Then \(xy = N\) and \(B + C = x + y + 2A\).
3. To minimize \(B + C\), choose divisor pair \(d, N/d\) with minimal sum. Since \(d\) and \(N/d\) are positive, the minimal sum occurs for a divisor near \(\sqrt{N}\).
4. Iterate through divisors \(d = 1..\lfloor \sqrt{N} \rfloor\) and compute minimum of \(d + N/d\). The answer is this minimum plus \(2A\).

This approach runs in \(O(\sqrt{A^2 + 1})\) per test case, which is safe for the given constraints.
