# [Galactic Import](https://www.spoj.com/problems/IMPORT/)

## Problem Summary
Each galaxy has up to 26 planets labeled `A`â€“`Z`. Every planet exports a good with a given value, connects to some other planets by
shipping lines and some planets are willing to open a direct line to Earth (marked with `*`). When goods pass through a planet,
5% is kept as fee. For each galaxy we must determine the planet whose good has the highest value on Earth after accounting for the
shipping losses. If multiple planets yield the same value, choose the alphabetically earliest planet.

## Algorithm
1. Parse the galaxy description building an undirected graph of planets.
2. Run a multi-source BFS starting from all planets marked `*` to compute the minimum number of hops to Earth for every planet.
3. For each reachable planet, compute its effective value `value * 0.95^distance`.
4. Select the planet with the highest effective value, breaking ties by letter.
5. Output `Import from X` with `X` being that planet.

## Complexity Analysis
With at most 26 planets, BFS runs in `O(N^2)` time and uses `O(N^2)` memory for the adjacency matrix.
