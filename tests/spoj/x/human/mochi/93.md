# [Numeral System of the Maya](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MAYA/)

## Problem Summary
Convert numbers written in the Mayan vigesimal system to decimal. Digits 0-19 are given using dots, dashes and the letter `S` for zero. Digits are listed from most significant to least. The third digit from the bottom has weight 360 instead of 400; higher digits resume multiplication by 20. The input contains multiple numbers separated by blank lines and terminated with `0`.

## Algorithm
1. Build a map from each possible Mayan digit pattern (strings like `".. -"` or `"- -"`) to its numeric value 0–19.
2. For each number:
   - Read `n`, then read `n` digit lines converting each using the map.
   - Process digits from least significant to most using positional weights: 1, 20, 360, 7200, ...
   - Accumulate `value += digit * weight` while updating `weight` (after weights 1 and 20, the next is 360 then multiplied by 20 thereafter).
3. Output the computed decimal value.

This runs in O(d) per number where d ≤ 7 is the number of digits.
