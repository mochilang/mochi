## Problem Summary
Maintain a sequence of integers under several operations:
- `MAKE-SAME i t c`: set `t` elements starting at position `i` to `c`.
- `INSERT i t s`: insert `t` numbers `s` after position `i` (at the front if `i` is 0).
- `DELETE i t`: remove `t` elements starting from position `i`.
- `REVERSE i t`: reverse `t` elements starting from position `i`.
- `GET-SUM i t`: report the sum of `t` elements starting from position `i`.
- `MAX-SUM`: report the maximum subarray sum of the whole sequence.

### Algorithm
The solution maintains the sequence in a mutable list and applies the
operations directly:
- Modifications, insertions, deletions and reverses rebuild the list or
swap elements inside the affected range.
- `GET-SUM` iterates through the specified slice accumulating the sum.
- `MAX-SUM` uses Kadane's algorithm to compute the maximum subarray sum
in linear time.

This straightforward approach runs in linear time with respect to the
length of the sequence for each operation, which is sufficient for the
test data.
