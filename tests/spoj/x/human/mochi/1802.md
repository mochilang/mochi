# [Edge](https://www.spoj.com/problems/EDGE/)

## Problem Summary
Given a sequence of letters `A` and `V` describing folds in a sheet of paper, each letter denotes whether the unfolded edge turns clockwise (`A`) or counter-clockwise (`V`). Starting at coordinates `(300, 420)` and moving initially to the right, output PostScript commands that trace the edge with 90-degree turns every 10 units.

## Algorithm
1. For each test case, set position `(x, y) = (300, 420)` and direction vector `(dx, dy) = (1, 0)` (pointing right).
2. Output the starting command `300 420 moveto`.
3. For each character in the input string:
   - Move 10 units in the current direction: `x += dx*10`, `y += dy*10`.
   - Output `x y lineto`.
   - Rotate the direction: clockwise for `A` (`dx,dy = dy,-dx`) and counter-clockwise for `V` (`dx,dy = -dy,dx`).
4. After processing all characters, move one final segment of 10 units in the last direction and output the endpoint.
5. Finish the drawing with `stroke` and `showpage`.

This algorithm runs in linear time relative to the length of the string.
