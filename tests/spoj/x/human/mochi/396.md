# [Hit or Miss](https://www.spoj.com/problems/HITOMISS/)

## Problem Summary
Simulate the multi-player "Hit or Miss" card game. A shuffled deck of 52 cards is held by the first player. Each round every player with cards reveals the top card while counting from 1 to 13 cyclically. If the card matches the count it is removed: players 1..p-1 pass it to the next player, and the last player discards it. Otherwise the card goes to the bottom of the same deck. After all players check, passed cards are added to the bottoms of the next players’ decks. Players without cards wait, resuming counting where they left off when they receive a card. Determine whether all cards are eventually discarded. If so, output the last matched card for each player; otherwise report "unwinnable".

## Algorithm
1. Initialize each player’s deck and count (starting at 1). Only the first player begins with the 52-card deck.
2. Repeat until all 52 cards are discarded or a previous state repeats:
   - **Step 1:** For every player with cards, compare the top card with the current count. If equal, record it and remove it; non-final players pass it to the next player, while the last player discards it and decreases the total card count. Otherwise, move the card to the bottom of the same deck. Increment that player’s count (wrapping after 13).
   - **Step 2:** Append passed cards to the bottoms of the next players’ decks.
   - Encode the decks and counts; if this state was seen before, the game is unwinnable.
3. If all cards are discarded, output the recorded last card of each player. Otherwise output "unwinnable".

## Complexity
Each round processes at most `p` players and up to 52 cards, so the per-round work is `O(p)`. State tracking ensures termination: at most the number of unique game states are stored, yielding `O(number of states)` memory usage.
