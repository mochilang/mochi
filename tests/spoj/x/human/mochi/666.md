# [Con-Junctions](https://www.spoj.com/problems/VOCV/)

## Problem Summary
Given up to 20 test cases, each describing a tree with `n` junctions (1 <= n <= 100010). Each test case provides `n-1` undirected edges. Placing a light on a junction illuminates all incident streets. Determine:

1. The minimum number of junctions that need lights so every street is illuminated.
2. The number of different optimal lighting sets modulo 10007.

## Algorithm
The given network is a tree, so we use dynamic programming on trees (minimum vertex cover).

1. Root the tree at node 1 and traverse it in depth-first order, recording processing order.
2. For each node `u`, compute two states:
   - `dp0[u]`, `ways0[u]`: size and count when `u` is not lit. All children must be lit.
   - `dp1[u]`, `ways1[u]`: size and count when `u` is lit. For each child choose the cheaper state (`dp0` vs `dp1`). If equal, add the counts.
3. Combine children contributions while processing nodes in reverse order.
4. The final answer is `min(dp0[root], dp1[root])`; if equal, sum their counts modulo 10007.

This computes both the minimum number of lights and the count of optimal configurations in O(n) time and O(n) memory.
