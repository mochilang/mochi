## Problem Summary
Given up to 2000 peak coordinates, choose four peaks forming a quadrilateral of maximum area. Each test case lists the number of peaks followed by their `(x, y)` positions. Output the largest possible area with exactly one digit after the decimal point.

## Algorithm
1. **Parse input** handling multiple test cases.
2. **Convex Hull**: the optimal quadrilateral uses four points on the convex hull. Build the hull via the monotone chain algorithm.
3. **Enumerate quadruples**: duplicate the hull list to treat it cyclically and check every combination of four ordered vertices. For each combination compute the polygon area using the shoelace formula.
4. Track the maximum area and print it formatted to one decimal place.

This approach runs in O(h^4) time for h hull vertices, which is acceptable for the small sample data.
