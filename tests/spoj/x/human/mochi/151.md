# [The Courier](https://www.spoj.com/problems/COURIER/)

## Problem Summary
Given up to 100 cities with undirected roads and up to five types of delivery orders, each specifying a source, destination, and number of parcels. The courier starts and ends at his home city and can carry only one parcel at a time. Determine the minimum total distance required to deliver all parcels in any order and return home.

## Algorithm
1. Precompute all-pairs shortest paths using the Floyd–Warshall algorithm.
2. Expand every order by its parcel count, producing at most 12 individual delivery tasks.
3. Use dynamic programming over subsets: `dp[mask][i]` stores the minimum distance to deliver tasks in `mask` and end at city `i`.
4. For each state, try delivering any remaining parcel, transitioning to its destination while adding travel from current city to pickup city and then to delivery city.
5. After all tasks are completed, add the distance back to the home city and take the minimum over possible ending cities.

The state space is `2^P * N` with `P ≤ 12` parcels and `N ≤ 100` cities, which is feasible.
