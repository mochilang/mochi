Problem: https://www.spoj.com/problems/BIA/

We have a directed network of `n` computers where computer `1` is the server.
A computer is **critical** if removing it causes some other computer to become
unreachable from the server. For each test case we output the numbers of all
critical computers in increasing order.

## Algorithm
1. Read the graph and build adjacency lists.
2. For every vertex `v` from `0..n-1` (treating vertex `0` as the server):
   - Perform a BFS from the server, ignoring node `v` and any edges leading to
     it.
   - If some other vertex is not reached, then `v` is critical.
3. Collect all such vertices (adding `1` to convert back to 1-based indexing),
   print their count and the sorted list.

The algorithm is `O(n*(n+m))`, which is sufficient for the provided examples
and small test sizes.
