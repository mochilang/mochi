# [Drink, on Ice](https://www.spoj.com/problems/DRINK)

## Problem Summary
Given masses and temperatures of water and ice in a closed system, determine the final temperature and amounts of water and ice after reaching thermal equilibrium.

## Algorithm
1. Let `cw = 4.19`, `ci = 2.09`, and `em = 335`.
2. Compute total energy relative to 0°C water:
   - `E = mw*cw*tw + mi*(ci*ti - em)`.
3. If `E >= 0`: all material becomes water at temperature `E / ((mw + mi) * cw)`.
4. Else if `E >= -em*(mw + mi)`: mixture at `0°C` with `ice = -E/em` grams and `water = total - ice` grams.
5. Else: everything freezes to ice at temperature `(E/(mw + mi) + em)/ci`.
6. Output the masses and temperature rounded to one decimal place.

This computation runs in constant time per test case.
