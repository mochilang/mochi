# WA - Problems Collection (Volume X)

This problem bundles ten independent math puzzles. We compute each answer separately and print one per line.

1. Let \(P(x) = x^5 + a_1x^4 + a_2x^3 + a_3x^2 + a_4x + a_5\). Since \(P(k)=2007k\) for \(k=1,2,3,4\), the polynomial \(P(x)-2007x\) has roots 1–4 and equals \((x-1)(x-2)(x-3)(x-4)(x-t)\). Evaluating at 10 and -5 and subtracting removes the unknown \(t\), yielding \(15(2007+9·8·7·6)=75465\).
2. The third elementary symmetric sum is maximized when the 100 positive integers are as equal as possible (Maclaurin's inequality). With 93 numbers 20 and 7 numbers 21 the sum is
   \(\binom{93}{3}20^3 + \binom{7}{3}21^3 + \binom{7}{2}\binom{93}{1}21^2·20 + \binom{7}{1}\binom{93}{2}21·20^2\).
3. Concatenate integers from 100 to 500; iteratively keep the remainder modulo 126 using \(r = (r·10^{d}+i)\bmod126\).
4. From geometric progression sums, \(S_{14}=S_7(1+r^7)\). Given \(S_7=7\) and \(S_{14}=2014\), we find \(S_7(S_{21}-S_{14})=2007^2\).
5. Brute force shows only \(n=4,6,7,23\) satisfy that \(n!\) equals a product of \(n-3\) consecutive integers; their sum is 40.
6. Solve coordinate system with a square having a side on \(y=2x-17\) and the opposite side on \(y=x^2\). Two valid squares have side lengths \(4\sqrt5\) and \(16\sqrt5\); areas 80 and 1280 sum to 1360.
7. Four non‑coplanar points form a tetrahedron. Selecting each vertex in turn as the common corner of a parallelepiped yields exactly three distinct parallelepipeds.
8. For divisibility of \(a_1x^{17}+a_2x^{16}+1\) by \(x^2-x-1\), reduce powers using Fibonacci identities to obtain linear equations. The solution is \(a_1=987\), \(a_2=-1597\), so \(a_1a_2=-1\,576\,239\).
9. Express the trigonometric terms via \(t=\tan x\). The function is symmetric and minimized at \(x=\frac{\pi}{4}\), giving value 4.
10. Solving the system
   \(5(x+1/x)=12(y+1/y)=13(z+1/z)\) and \(xy+yz+zx=1\) leads to \(x=1/5\), \(y=2/3\), \(z=1\). Then \(x^4+y^4+z^4=60706/50625\) and \(m+n=111331\).
