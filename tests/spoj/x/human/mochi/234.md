# HOLIDAY1 - Getting Rid of the Holidays (Act I)

King Johnny schedules many periodic holidays. Each holiday occurs every `t_i` days and several may occur on the same day. We may remove exactly `k` holidays and wish to maximize the minimum number of days between any two remaining celebrations.

For two holidays with periods `a` and `b`, the gap between some of their celebrations can eventually be as small as `gcd(a, b)`. For a set of holidays `S`, the shortest gap that will ever occur equals `min_{i<j in S} gcd(t_i, t_j)`. Therefore the task is to choose `n-k` holidays that maximize this value.

Since `n â‰¤ 30`, we precompute the gcd for every pair and collect all distinct gcd values. These are the only possible answers, so we sort them in descending order. For each candidate value `d` we build a graph connecting holidays whose pairwise gcd is at least `d`. We then perform a backtracking search for a clique of size `n-k` in this graph. The first candidate that yields such a clique gives the maximal minimum gap; its complement tells us which holidays to remove. When `n-k = 1` we simply keep the holiday with the largest period.
