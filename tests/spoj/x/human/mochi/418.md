# Necklace

Given N points (xi, yi) we must choose radii ri ≥ 0 so that only circles
centered at consecutive points intersect.  Let di be the distance between
point i and i+1 (with point N+1 = point 1).  We enforce tangency between
neighbours: ri + r{i+1} = di.

Define alternating coefficients:

```
sign[0] = 1   ; s[0] = 0
sign[i] = -sign[i-1]
s[i] = d{i-1} - s{i-1}    for i > 0
```

Every radius becomes r{i} = sign[i] * x + s[i].  For odd N the last
equation gives x = (d{N-1} - s{N-1}) / 2 and all radii are fixed.
For even N the system has one degree of freedom.  Bounds for x arise from
non‑negativity and from preventing non‑adjacent intersections:

- if sign[i] and sign[j] are both 1:  x ≤ (d{ij} - s[i] - s[j]) / 2
- if both are -1:  x ≥ (s[i] + s[j] - d{ij}) / 2
- if signs differ, the pair does not constrain x

Choosing any x inside the accumulated interval yields radii satisfying
all constraints. Distances use a Newton iteration for square root.
