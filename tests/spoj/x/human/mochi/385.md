# [Game schedule required](https://www.spoj.com/problems/GAME/)

## Problem Summary
Given \(n\) teams and a list of \(n-1\) games that Sheikh Abdul wants to see, distribute the games into rounds of an elimination tournament. In each round every remaining team plays at most one game; if the number of teams is even every team plays exactly one, otherwise exactly one team receives a wildcard. After all rounds only one team remains and is declared the winner. A schedule always exists for the provided data and any valid schedule may be printed.

## Algorithm
The list of games forms a tree because there are \(n\) teams and \(n-1\) games. Root this tree at an arbitrary team which becomes the eventual champion. For each round:

1. Perform a depthâ€“first search starting at the root. When returning from a child node, if neither the child nor the parent have been paired in this round, pair them with the parent as the winner. Collect all such matches; they form a maximum matching of the current tree.
2. Any remaining unmatched team becomes the wildcard (when the number of teams is odd).
3. Output all matches as "winner defeats loser" and the wildcard if present. Remove the losers from the tree and repeat.

The process continues until one team remains. Each round eliminates as many teams as possible while respecting the one-game-per-team rule, and because the graph is a tree the DFS greedy pairing always yields a valid schedule.

## Complexity
Building the schedule requires \(O(n^2)\) time in the worst case: there are at most \(n-1\) rounds and each DFS over the shrinking tree touches up to \(n\) nodes. The memory usage is \(O(n)\).
