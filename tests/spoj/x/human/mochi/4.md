# [Transform the Expression](https://www.spoj.com/problems/ONP/)

## Problem Summary
Convert algebraic expressions containing operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^` and parentheses into Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). Operands are lowercase letters. For each input expression, output its RPN form.

## Algorithm
Use the shunting-yard algorithm:
1. Iterate through each character of the expression.
2. Append operands directly to the output string.
3. Push `(` onto a stack.
4. For an operator, pop operators from the stack while the top has higher precedence (or equal precedence for left-associative operators), then push the current operator.
5. Upon `)`, pop and output operators until `(` is encountered.
6. After processing all characters, pop and output remaining operators.

Operator precedence: `+`/`-` < `*`/`/` < `^` (`^` is right-associative).

## Complexity
For an expression of length `n`, each character is processed a constant number of times, yielding `O(n)` time and `O(n)` stack space.
