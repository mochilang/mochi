## Problem Summary
Given a convex polygon with `n` vertices and a triangulation (described by `n-2` triangles),
find the maximum number of triangulation triangles that can be intersected by some
triangle whose vertices are also vertices of the polygon.

## Algorithm
1. Build the dual graph of the triangulation.  Each triangle becomes a node and two
   nodes are joined if their triangles share an edge.  For a convex polygon this graph
   is a tree.
2. For every triangle `v` in this tree perform a BFS:
   - compute the distance from `v` to every other triangle,
   - remember for each triangle which neighbor of `v` the shortest path starts with.
   For each neighbor branch keep the farthest distance encountered.
3. Collect all branch distances, sort them in descending order and take the largest
   three.  The number of triangles intersected by choosing `v` as the central triangle is
   `1 + d1 + d2 + d3` where `d1..d3` are those distances (use fewer if less branches).
4. The maximum over all `v` is the desired result.

The BFS per triangle runs in `O(m)` where `m = n-2`.  Performing it for every triangle
keeps the total complexity `O(m^2)` (at most about one million operations for `n â‰¤ 1000`).
