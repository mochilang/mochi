# CNHARD - CN Tower (Hard)

Christy wants to photograph several landmarks from a restaurant that rotates 360° every 72 minutes (12 seconds per degree). She stands still and uses a flash that requires `F` seconds to recharge. Each landmark is specified by its compass angle. She may choose her initial orientation so that the first picture is taken at time zero. After each shot she must wait both for the restaurant to rotate the next landmark into view and for the flash to recharge. If the flash is not ready when the landmark passes, she must wait another full rotation. After the last photo she waits one more recharge. The restaurant closes at midnight (8640 s after 9:36 pm), so this total time must not exceed 8640 s.

Algorithm:

1. Parse angles with hundredth‑degree precision to avoid floating errors. Sort the angles and append each angle plus 36000 to handle cyclic wrap‑around.
2. For every landmark as a potential starting point:
   - Simulate taking pictures in order of increasing angle.
   - For each next landmark with angular difference `d` hundredth‑degrees, the first time it appears is `d * 12` centiseconds. While this time is before the flash has recharged (`t + F*100`), add a full rotation (432000 cs). The photo is taken at this resulting time.
   - Keep the total time `t` for all photos; add the final recharge time.
3. Track the minimal total time among all starting positions. Convert centiseconds back to seconds, rounding up, and compare against 8640. If it exceeds that limit, output `not possible`.

This approach runs in `O(n^2)` for `n ≤ 1000`, which is fast enough.
