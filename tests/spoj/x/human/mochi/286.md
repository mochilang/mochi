# [Selfish Cities](https://www.spoj.com/problems/SCITIES/)

## Problem Summary
Each test case gives numbers of seller and buyer cities followed by triples `(c1, c2, g)` indicating that seller `c1` can sell `g` goods to buyer `c2`. Every seller may connect to at most one buyer and every buyer to at most one seller. The goal is to maximize the total amount of goods exchanged.

## Algorithm
1. Build a weight matrix `weights` where `weights[i][j]` stores the goods that seller `i` can sell to buyer `j`.
2. Let `N` be `max(C1, C2)`. Create an `N×N` matrix and pad missing entries with zeros. Convert weights to costs by subtracting each weight from the maximum weight so the problem becomes a minimization task.
3. Apply the **Hungarian algorithm** to the cost matrix to obtain an optimal assignment.
4. Sum the original weights of the chosen pairs to get the maximal amount of goods exchanged.

This runs in `O(N^3)` time, which is fast enough for `N ≤ 100`.
