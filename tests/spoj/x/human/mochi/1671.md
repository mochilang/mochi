## Problem Summary
For integers `n` (1 ≤ n < 10^100) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), find the smallest positive integer `T` such that for every `a ≥ 1` the difference `n^(a+T) - n^a` is divisible by `10^k`. Output `-1` if no such `T` exists.

## Algorithm
1. Let `v2` and `v5` be the multiplicities of prime factors `2` and `5` in `n`.
2. If both `v2 ≥ k` and `v5 ≥ k`, then any `T` works; return `1`.
3. If `0 < v2 < k` or `0 < v5 < k`, divisibility is impossible because `n^T - 1` is not divisible by that prime; return `-1`.
4. Otherwise `n` is coprime to `10` in the missing prime(s). For each prime power modulus:
   - For `2^k` (when `v2 = 0`): compute the multiplicative order of `n` modulo `2^k`.
   - For `5^k` (when `v5 = 0`): compute the multiplicative order of `n` modulo `5^k` by reducing Euler's totient `φ(5^k) = 4·5^(k-1)` through its prime factors `2` and `5`.
5. The final answer is the least common multiple of the required orders for `2^k` and `5^k`.

This procedure works with big integers and runs in `O(k log k)` time using fast modular exponentiation.
