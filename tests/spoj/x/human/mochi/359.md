## Problem Summary
Given the number of players `N` and a sequence of winners for each ball, determine who wins the match in the N-player version of Alpha Centauri Tennis.

## Algorithm
1. Maintain arrays `points`, `games`, and `sets` of size `N` for the current game, set, and match.
2. For each ball winner `P`:
   - If `P` has 3 points and every other player has at most 2, `P` wins the game.
   - Else if `P` already has 4 points, `P` wins the game.
   - Else if some other player has 4 points, decrement that player's points and increment `P`'s.
   - Otherwise increment `P`'s points.
   - When a game is won:
     1. Increment the winner's game count and reset all players' points.
     2. If the winner has at least 6 games and is ahead of every other player by at least two, the set is awarded. If no other player won a game in the set, it counts as two sets.
     3. Reset game counts. If the player now has at least three sets, the match is over.
3. Output the letter corresponding to the match winner.

The simulation touches each ball once, running in `O(|S|)` time and `O(N)` space.
