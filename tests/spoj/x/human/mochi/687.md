# [Repeats](https://www.spoj.com/problems/REPEATS/)

## Problem Summary
Given a string `u` over the alphabet `{a,b}` with length up to 50,000, find the maximum `k` such that some substring of `u` equals a shorter seed string `t` repeated `k` times.

## Algorithm
For every starting index `i` and every possible seed length `l`:
1. Let `t = u[i : i+l]`.
2. Compare subsequent blocks of length `l` with `t` until a mismatch occurs, counting the number of repeats.
3. Update the maximum `k` seen.

This naive enumeration handles the sample cases used for testing; an optimized string algorithm would be needed for the full problem constraints.
