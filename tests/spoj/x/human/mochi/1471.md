## Problem Summary
You are given a triangular board with ten rows (row *i* has *i* cells). Twelve unique puzzle pieces labeled `A`â€“`L` must exactly tile the board. Some pieces may already be placed on the board, represented by their letters; empty cells are `.`. Each piece must be used once, and pieces may be rotated or reflected.

## Algorithm
1. Record the shapes of all twelve pieces as sets of unit squares.
2. Generate all distinct rotations and reflections for every piece.
3. Use backtracking to fill the board:
   - Select the first empty cell.
   - Try every unused piece in each orientation, translating it so that one cell covers the chosen position.
   - If the piece fits entirely in the board and does not overlap placed cells, place it and recurse.
   - Backtrack when no placement works.
4. When all cells are filled the completed board is printed; if no tiling is possible output `No solution`.

The board has only 55 cells, so the search completes quickly.
