# [Skyscraper Floors](https://www.spoj.com/problems/SCRAPER/)

## Problem Summary
Given a skyscraper with F floors and E elevators, each elevator i starts at floor Y_i and stops every X_i floors. Determine if one can move from floor A to floor B using only elevators (switching between elevators is allowed on floors where both stop).

## Algorithm
1. For every elevator i, represent its serviced floors as an arithmetic progression starting at Y_i with step X_i.
2. Build an undirected graph of elevators where an edge connects elevators i and j if they share any floor below F. A common floor exists when `gcd(X_i, X_j)` divides `Y_i - Y_j`; compute the first such floor using the Chinese Remainder Theorem and ensure it is `< F`.
3. Perform BFS starting from all elevators that serve floor A. During the search, if an elevator serving floor B is reached, the move is possible.
4. If BFS finishes without reaching an elevator serving B, then the furniture cannot be moved.

The graph has at most 100 elevators, so building it and running BFS both run in O(EÂ²) time.
