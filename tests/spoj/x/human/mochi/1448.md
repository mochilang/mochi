# [3D Cover](https://www.spoj.com/problems/COVER2/)
## Problem Summary
Given up to 100 axis-aligned cubes in 3D space, each specified by center `(x,y,z)` and half-side `r`, compute the volume of their union.
## Algorithm
1. For each cube, compute its min and max coordinates on all axes `(x-r,x+r)` etc.
2. Collect all x, y, z boundaries, sort them, and remove duplicates. These provide a compressed grid with at most `2n` coordinates per axis.
3. Use a 3D difference array over the compressed grid. For each cube with index ranges `[x1,x2)`, `[y1,y2)`, `[z1,z2)` apply the eight inclusion-exclusion updates at the corners.
4. Convert the difference array to coverage counts with three prefix-sum passes (x then y then z).
5. For every cell between consecutive coordinates, if its count is positive add `dx*dy*dz` to the total volume.
This runs in `O(n + X*Y*Z)` where `X,Y,Z â‰¤ 200`, comfortably within the limits.
