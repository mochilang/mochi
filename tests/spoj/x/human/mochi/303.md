# [The Unstable Cube](https://www.spoj.com/problems/UCUBE/)

## Problem Summary
Given six orthogonal projections of an N×N×N cube (front, left, back, right, top, bottom), each cell shows either a color or '.' meaning empty line of sight. Some blocks may be missing. Compute the maximum number of blocks that can remain consistent with all views.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize a 3D array `cube[x][y][z]` filled with `?` representing unknown blocks.
2. Repeat while changes occur:
   - For each view and each cell:
     - If it is '.', mark every position along that line as empty.
     - Otherwise scan the line from the viewer into the cube:
       - If a cell is '?', assign it the required color and stop.
       - If a cell already has the color, stop.
       - If a cell has a different color, mark it empty and continue.
3. After convergence count all cells that are not '.', yielding the maximum remaining blocks.

The cube size is at most 10³, so this iterative elimination is efficient.
