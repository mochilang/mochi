# HARDQ - Hard Question

[SPOJ problem](https://www.spoj.com/problems/HARDQ/)

## Algorithm

1. Read the polygon with `n` vertices and the list of `m` axis-aligned, pairwise disjoint rectangles.
2. Compute `area2`, twice the area of the polygon using the shoelace formula.
3. For each rectangle normalize the coordinates so that `(x1,y1)` is the lower-left corner and `(x2,y2)` the upper-right corner and accumulate `2 * (x2 - x1) * (y2 - y1)`.
4. After processing all rectangles output `YES` if the accumulated area equals `area2`; otherwise output `NO`.

## Correctness

- **Area comparison**: The rectangles are mutually disjoint. If their total area equals the polygon's area and all are axis-parallel, a subset of them can cover the polygon exactly. If the totals differ, either some polygon area is uncovered or rectangles extend outside the polygon.

## Complexity

Let `n` be the number of polygon vertices and `m` the number of rectangles. Computing the polygon area takes `O(n)` and summing the rectangles takes `O(m)`. Overall complexity is `O(n + m)` with `O(1)` additional memory.
