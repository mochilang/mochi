# [Mixtures](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MIXTURES/)

## Problem Summary
Harry must mix `n` mixtures, each with a color `0..99`. Mixing two adjacent mixtures of colors `a` and `b` produces a new mixture of color `(a+b) mod 100` and generates `a*b` units of smoke. The task is to determine the minimum smoke generated when all mixtures are combined into one.

## Algorithm
1. Let `dp[i][j]` be the minimum smoke produced when mixing mixtures `i` through `j`.
2. Precompute prefix sums modulo 100 to quickly get the resulting color of any subarray: `color(i,j) = (prefix[j] - prefix[i-1]) mod 100`.
3. For each segment length from 2 to `n`, compute `dp[i][j]` by trying all split points `k` between `i` and `j`:
   - Smoke for split `k` is `dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + color(i,k) * color(k+1,j)`.
   - Keep the minimum over all `k`.
4. The answer for a test case is `dp[0][n-1]`.

This dynamic programming runs in `O(n^3)` time and `O(n^2)` memory.
