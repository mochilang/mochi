# SPOJ MAZE - The Long and Narrow Maze

Problem: https://www.spoj.com/problems/MAZE/

We are given a 3×n grid.  Each cell contains one of three pipe
patterns: 0 – empty, 1 – straight pipe, 2 – bent pipe.  Every square
may be rotated by multiples of 90°.  Determine whether the squares can
be oriented so that there is a continuous passage from the left edge of
the grid to the right edge.

## Algorithm

1. For a column described by three block types `(a,b,c)` we examine all
   rotations of its three blocks (there are at most `4³` possibilities).
   For each starting row (top/middle/bottom) we compute which rows on
the right side are reachable if the path enters the column from that
row.  This yields a bitmask `trans[a][b][c][start]`.
2. Initially every row on the left edge is a potential entry (`cur =
   0b111`).  For each column:
   - Look up its precomputed transition for each row present in
     `cur`.
   - Union the resulting exit rows to form the new `cur` bitmask.
3. After processing all columns, if `cur` is non‑zero a path exists,
   otherwise it does not.

The precomputation is constant (27 column types × 64 rotations) and
processing each test case is linear in `n`.
