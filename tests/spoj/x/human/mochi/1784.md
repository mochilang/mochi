## Problem Summary
Given `N` points `(Ai, Bi, Ci, Di)` in four-dimensional space, find the maximum value of
`|Ai - Aj| + |Bi - Bj| + |Ci - Cj| + |Di - Dj|` over all pairs of indices. Each coordinate
is a real number and `N` can be up to 100000.

## Algorithm
The expression is the Manhattan distance in four dimensions. The maximum distance can
be computed without comparing every pair:

1. For each of the 16 sign combinations `(±1, ±1, ±1, ±1)` compute the projection
   `p = s1*Ai + s2*Bi + s3*Ci + s4*Di` for each point.
2. Track the minimum and maximum `p` for each combination.
3. For every combination compute `max_p - min_p` and take the largest of these values.

This works because the L1 distance between two points equals the maximum difference of
these signed projections.

## Complexity
Processing each point across 16 combinations gives `O(16N)` time, effectively `O(N)`,
with `O(1)` additional memory. The result is printed with exactly three decimal places.
