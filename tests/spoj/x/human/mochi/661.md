# QUEST5 - Nail Them

Link: https://www.spoj.com/problems/QUEST5/

We are given several planks on a table represented as intervals \([a, b]\). A single nail placed at position `x` fixes every plank covering `x`. The task is to find the minimum number of nails needed so that each plank is nailed at least once.

This is the classic interval stabbing problem. Sort all planks by their right endpoint. Traverse them in that order and maintain the position of the last nail. Whenever the current plank starts after the last nail position, place a new nail at its right endpoint and update the last nail position. Otherwise the plank is already nailed.

Sorting dominates the complexity, giving an overall runtime of \(O(n \log n)\) per test case, where \(n\) is the number of planks.
