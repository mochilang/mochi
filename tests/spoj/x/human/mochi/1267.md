## Problem Summary
Given parameters \(m,n,a,b,c\) and an \(m \times n\) configuration of Conway's Game of Life, determine the minimum number of generations back to a *Garden of Eden* stateâ€”one that has no predecessor under the given rules. If the current configuration itself is a Garden of Eden, the answer is 0. If it can never arise from a Garden of Eden, output -1.

## Algorithm
1. Encode each configuration as a bit mask of \(m \cdot n \le 20\) cells.
2. Precompute for every cell the mask of its neighbours.
3. Iterate through all \(2^{m\cdot n}\) states. For each state compute the next state by counting live neighbours using bit operations and apply the \(a,b,c\) rules. Build a reverse adjacency list: for each next state store the list of states that lead to it.
4. Perform a breadth-first search from the target state traversing predecessors using the reverse graph. The first state encountered with no predecessors is a Garden of Eden; its distance from the target is the answer.
5. If BFS finishes without finding such a state, output -1.

This approach is feasible because the state space is at most \(2^{20} = 1{,}048{,}576\) states.
