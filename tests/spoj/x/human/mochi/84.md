# [Shortcut](https://www.spoj.com/problems/SHORTCUT/)

## Problem Summary
Given a simple grid walk of `n` sections described by a string of `N`, `E`, `S`, `W`, find the shortest horizontal or vertical segment connecting two break points of the route. Output the length in 10â€‘meter units, the indices of the starting and ending break points, and the direction from start to end. Among equally short segments choose the one with the earliest start, and if tied, the one with the furthest end.

## Algorithm
1. Trace the walk, recording the coordinates of each break point and prefix counts of horizontal and vertical moves.
2. For every pair `(i, j)` with `i < j`, test whether the points share the same `x` or `y` coordinate.
3. Ensure the path between them is not already straight: a vertical shortcut requires at least one horizontal move between `i` and `j`, and vice versa.
4. Among all valid segments, pick the one with minimal length, preferring the earliest start and then the furthest end in case of ties.

This straightforward pairwise search takes `O(n^2)` time and `O(n)` memory.
