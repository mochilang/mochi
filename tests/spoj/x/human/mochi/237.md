# [Sums in a Triangle](https://www.spoj.com/problems/SUMTRIAN/)

## Problem Summary
For each test case, a triangle of positive integers (at most 100 rows, values < 100) is given. Starting from the top, move to adjacent numbers on the row below to reach the base. Determine the maximum possible sum along such a path for each triangle.

## Algorithm
1. Iterate through the triangle rows maintaining an array `dp` of maximum sums to reach each position in the current row.
2. Initialize `dp` with the first row's single value.
3. For each subsequent row, compute a new array where `newdp[j] = row[j] + max(dp[j-1], dp[j])`, treating missing neighbors as 0.
4. Replace `dp` with `newdp` and continue until all rows are processed.
5. The answer for a test case is the maximum value in `dp` after the final row.

This dynamic programming approach runs in O(n^2) time for n rows using O(n) extra space.
