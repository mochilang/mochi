# NSYSTEM - Numeral System

[Problem statement](https://www.spoj.com/problems/NSYSTEM/)

## Algorithm

For each test we read two MCXI-strings and need to output their sum as an MCXI-string.

* Map letters to values: `m = 1000`, `c = 100`, `x = 10`, `i = 1`.
* To convert an MCXI-string to its integer value:
  1. Scan characters left to right.
  2. If a digit `2`-`9` is seen, store it as a multiplier for the next letter.
  3. When a letter is encountered, add multiplier (or `1` if none) times its value to the total and reset the multiplier.
* To convert an integer back to an MCXI-string:
  1. For each letter `m`, `c`, `x`, `i` in this order, compute how many times its value fits into the remaining number.
  2. If the count is greater than zero, append the count (omitting `1`) followed by the letter and subtract `count * value` from the number.

## Correctness

The parsing step sums the contributions of all letter-digit pairs, so it yields the integer represented by the string.  The reconstruction step decomposes the result into thousands, hundreds, tens and ones and writes the unique MCXI representation because each letter is processed in order and digits are written only when counts are greater than one.

## Complexity Analysis

Each string has length at most eight, so both parsing and reconstruction run in `O(1)` time per test case.
