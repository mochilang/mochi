# [Letter Sequence Analysis](https://www.spoj.com/problems/SEQUENCE/)

## Problem Summary
Given an arbitrary text, report the most frequent contiguous letter sequences of
lengths 1 through 5. Only alphabetic characters contribute to sequences and the
comparison is case-insensitive. For each length, output up to the five most
common frequencies, listing all sequences having that frequency in alphabetical
order.

## Algorithm
1. **Read and Normalize Text**
   - Read the entire input and convert letters to uppercase.
   - Non-letter characters act as delimiters; they reset the current word.
2. **Count Sequences**
   - For each word of letters, generate all substrings of lengths 1..5 and
     increment their counts in a map `count[length][sequence]`.
3. **Group by Frequency**
   - Convert `count[length]` into a map `freq â†’ sequences`.
   - Sort frequencies descending and sequences within each frequency ascending.
4. **Output**
   - For each length 1..5, print the header followed by up to five lines of
     "Frequency = f, Sequence(s) = (seq1,seq2,...)" using the sorted order.

This approach scans the input once and processes each substring a constant number
of times, yielding overall time complexity O(n) for input length n.
