## Problem Summary
Given a grid (max 25x25) of digits representing traversal times, with `X` as walls, `S` as the start and `D` as the destination, find the minimum time to reach `D` from `S`. Moving to a square costs its digit value; `S` and `D` have zero cost. Movements are allowed only vertically or horizontally. Multiple test cases separated by an empty line end with `0 0`.

## Algorithm
Model the grid as a weighted graph and apply Dijkstra's algorithm. Each cell is a node; edges connect adjacent non-wall cells, and the weight of entering a cell equals its digit. Starting from `S`, repeatedly select the unvisited cell with the lowest current distance and relax its neighbors until `D` is processed.

This approach runs in `O((w*h)^2)` time—fast enough for at most 25×25 cells—and uses `O(w*h)` memory.
