# [Mobile Service](https://www.spoj.com/problems/SERVICE/)

## Problem Summary
A company has three mobile service employees initially at locations 1, 2, and 3. For each request at a location, exactly one employee may move to that location (if none is already there). Moving from `p` to `q` costs `C(p,q)` and employees may never share a location. Requests must be served in the given order. Determine the minimal total cost to serve all requests.

## Algorithm
1. Process requests sequentially using dynamic programming.
2. After serving request `i` at location `r_i`, one worker is at `r_i`; the other two are at distinct locations `a<b`. Store the minimal cost in `dp[a][b]`.
3. For the next request `r_{i+1}`:
   - If `r_{i+1}` equals `r_i`, the same worker serves at zero cost.
   - If it equals `a` or `b`, that worker serves and the remaining two locations become the new state.
   - Otherwise the location is empty; try moving each of the three workers there, adding the corresponding movement cost and forming the new state.
4. The number of states is `O(L^2)`; transitions per state are constant. The answer is the minimum `dp[a][b]` after all requests.

This runs in `O(N * L^2)` time and `O(L^2)` memory, which fits the limits (`L ≤ 200`, `N ≤ 1000`).
