## Problem Summary
Given the count of positive integers that cannot be written as `a*p + b*q` for two primes `p` and `q`, compute the number of integers less than `p*q` that are coprime to `p*q`.

## Algorithm
1. For coprime integers `p` and `q`, the number of non-representable values is `(p-1)*(q-1)/2`.
2. The Euler totient of `p*q` is `(p-1)*(q-1)`, which is exactly twice the provided number.
3. Read the large input value `n` as a string.
4. Multiply `n` by two using digit-by-digit addition to handle up to 99 digits.
5. Output the resulting value.

This algorithm runs in `O(d)` time for `d` input digits and uses `O(d)` extra space.
