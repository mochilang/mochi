# QTREE - Query on a tree
https://www.spoj.com/problems/QTREE/

We are given an undirected tree with weights on edges. Two types of operations are supported:

- `CHANGE i ti` updates the weight of the i-th edge.
- `QUERY a b` asks for the maximum edge weight along the unique path between nodes `a` and `b`.

Because the graph is a tree, between any two nodes there is exactly one simple path.  The program stores
for each vertex its adjacent vertices and the index of the connecting edge as well as a separate array of edge weights.

For a `QUERY` we perform a breadthâ€‘first search starting from `a` until `b` is reached.  During the search we remember
for each visited node its parent node and the edge used to reach it.  Walking back from `b` to `a` via these parent pointers
retrieves the path and allows tracking the maximum edge weight encountered.

A `CHANGE` operation simply updates the corresponding entry in the edge weight array.

This straightforward approach runs in \(O(N)\) time for each query, which is sufficient for the provided test data.
