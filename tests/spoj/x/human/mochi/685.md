# [Partition the sequence](https://www.spoj.com/problems/SEQPAR/)

## Problem Summary
Given an integer sequence of length `n` and an integer `k`, split the sequence into `k` contiguous parts so that the largest sum among the parts is minimized. Output this minimal possible maximum segment sum.

## Algorithm
1. Compute prefix sums `pref[i]` for the first `i` elements.
2. Use dynamic programming where `dp[i][j]` is the minimal possible value of the largest segment sum when partitioning the first `i` elements into `j` parts.
3. Recurrence:
   - Base: `dp[0][0] = -∞` and for `i ≥ 1`, `dp[i][1] = pref[i]`.
   - For `j > 1`, evaluate all split points `p` (0 ≤ p < i) and set
     `dp[i][j] = min( max(dp[p][j-1], pref[i] - pref[p]) )`.
4. The answer is `dp[n][k]`.

The dynamic programming explores every possible partition point, leading to `O(n^2 * k)` time and `O(n * k)` memory.
