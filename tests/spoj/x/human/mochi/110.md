# SPOJ CISTFILL - Fill the Cisterns

We are given several rectangular cisterns.  Each cistern is defined by its base
height `b`, height `h` and base rectangle of width `w` and depth `d`.  When
water is poured into the connected network, every cistern is filled from the
bottom up.  If the water volume exceeds the total capacity we must report
`OVERFLOW`.  Otherwise we have to output the final water level.

## Algorithm

For each test case:

1. Read all cisterns and compute their total capacity `h*w*d`.
2. If the requested volume `V` is larger than the total capacity, print
   `OVERFLOW`.
3. Otherwise perform a binary search on the water level `x` (measured in
   centimetres) between the lowest base and highest top among all cisterns.
   * For a candidate level `x`, the contribution of a cistern is
     `w*d*max(0, min(h, x-b))` scaled by `100`.
   * Sum the contributions and compare with `V` (also scaled by `100`) to decide
     the search direction.
4. When the search narrows to a single level, output it rounded to two decimal
   places.

The complexity is `O(n log R)` where `R` is the height range (at most
`10^6`).
