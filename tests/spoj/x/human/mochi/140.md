# The Loner

For each test we perform a breadth-first search over game states.  A state is the
string of `0` and `1` describing the board.  From any state we generate new
states by replacing `110` with `001` or `011` with `100`, which corresponds to a
legal jump of a pawn.  The search stops when a state with a single `1` is found
(winning) or when all reachable states have been processed (losing).

The number of pawns decreases with every move, therefore the search space is
finite.  The BFS ensures that every reachable configuration is examined at most
once.
