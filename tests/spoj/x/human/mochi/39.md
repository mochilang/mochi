## Problem Summary
Given the weights of an empty pig `E` and a full pig `F`, along with `N` coin types described by value `P` and weight `W`, determine the minimum amount of money that could be inside. The total weight of coins must be exactly `F - E`. If no combination of coins matches this weight, report that it is impossible.

## Algorithm
1. Compute the target weight `T = F - E`.
2. Create an array `dp[0..T]` initialized with a large value `INF`; set `dp[0] = 0`.
3. For each weight `w` from `1` to `T`:
   - For each coin type `(P, W)`:
     - If `W <= w`, update `dp[w] = min(dp[w], dp[w - W] + P)`.
4. After filling `dp`, if `dp[T]` is still `INF`, print `"This is impossible."`; otherwise print `dp[T]` as the minimum money.

This is an unbounded knapsack DP running in `O(N*T)` time with `O(T)` memory, where `T` is the weight difference.
