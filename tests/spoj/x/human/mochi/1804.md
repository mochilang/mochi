# Genetic Code (SPOJ GENETIC)

To output any ternary Thue sequence of length `n`, build the sequence one
character at a time while ensuring no adjacent subsegments are equal.  We try
letters `N`, `O`, and `P` in order for each position and accept the first that
keeps the string *square-free* (no `XX` pattern).  If none works we backtrack to
the previous position and try the next alternative.  Because square-free words
exist for any length over a three-symbol alphabet, this backtracking search
always succeeds for `n â‰¤ 5000`.  Checking a candidate of length `L` scans up to
`L/2` pairs, giving an overall `O(n^2)` algorithm.
