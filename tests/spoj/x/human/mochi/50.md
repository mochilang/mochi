## Problem Summary
Given a directed graph of bus stops where stop 1 is the central checkpoint,
compute the minimum total travel cost so that each volunteer goes from stop 1 to
his assigned stop in the morning and returns to stop 1 in the evening.

## Algorithm
1. Build adjacency lists for all edges and another set for the reversed edges.
2. Run Dijkstra's algorithm from node 1 on the original graph to obtain the
   cheapest cost to reach every stop.
3. Run Dijkstra again from node 1 on the reversed graph to obtain the cheapest
   cost to return from each stop to node 1.
4. For every stop `i`, add `dist1[i] + dist2[i]` to the answer.

Running Dijkstra twice yields a total complexity of
`O((P + Q) log P)`, which meets the problem's limits.
