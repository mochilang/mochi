# CANTON - Count on Cantor

[Problem link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CANTON/)

## Algorithm
The positive rationals are enumerated by diagonals on an infinite grid.
For a term `n`:

1. Find the smallest diagonal `d` such that `n <= d(d+1)/2`.
2. Let `off = d(d+1)/2 - n` (steps from the end of diagonal `d`).
3. If `d` is even, the diagonal is traversed top-to-bottom:
   - numerator = `d - off`
   - denominator = `1 + off`
   Otherwise, for odd `d`, traversal is bottom-to-top:
   - numerator = `1 + off`
   - denominator = `d - off`.
4. Output `TERM n IS numerator/denominator`.

Because `d` is at most `√(2n)`, searching for the correct diagonal takes
`O(√n)` time, which is fast for `n ≤ 10^7` and `t ≤ 20`.
