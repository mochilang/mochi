# SPOJ RHOMBS - Rhombs

Problem: https://www.spoj.com/problems/RHOMBS/

Given a rhombastic polygon on the triangular grid, every tile in any
valid partition is a rhomb consisting of two adjacent triangles. There
are three orientations of rhombs; the numbers of each orientation are
uniquely determined by the polygon's shape.

## Algorithm
1. Model the triangular grid using 3D coordinates `(x, y, z)` with
   `x + y + z = 0`. Directions `1..6` correspond to steps
   `(1,-1,0)`, `(0,1,-1)`, `(-1,0,1)`, `(-1,1,0)`, `(0,-1,1)`,
   `(1,0,-1)`.
2. Walk around the polygon accumulating these vectors to get the list
   of vertices in 3D.
3. The number of rhombs of types A, B and C equals the area of the
   polygon projected onto the `XY`, `YZ` and `ZX` planes respectively.
   Compute each projected area via the shoelace formula on the
   corresponding coordinate pairs.
4. Output the three areas in order.

Each unit rhomb of a particular orientation projects to a unit square
in exactly one of these planes, so these projected areas count the
rhombs of each type.
