# [Ranklist Sorting](https://www.spoj.com/problems/RSORTING/)

## Problem Summary
Given the scores of players in their current order, we must create the ranklist
sorted in decreasing score. The only allowed operation moves a player from
position `i` to position `j` and costs `i + j`. Determine a sequence of moves
with minimum total cost.

## Algorithm
1. Assign each score its rank in the final decreasing order.
2. For each position `i`, compute weight `w = i + rank[i]`.
3. Find a maximum-weight increasing subsequence of the rank array using
   O(n²) dynamic programming. Players in this subsequence remain in place.
4. For every other player, move it once from its current position to its final
   rank, processing moved players in increasing rank order and updating the
   list each time.
5. Output the resulting move sequence.

This approach minimizes the sum of costs because moving a player costs
`i + rank`, so keeping the subsequence with maximum total weight leaves the
least-cost players to move. The algorithm runs in O(n²) time and O(n) space for
n ≤ 1000.
