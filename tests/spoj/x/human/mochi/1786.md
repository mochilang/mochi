## Problem Summary
Given a number `n` encoded as `"xy ez"` where `n = (10*x + y) * 10^z`, repeatedly remove every second person from a circle of `n` people until one remains. Input ends with `00e0`. Output the survivor's position assuming counting starts from person `1` and person `2` is removed first.

## Algorithm
1. Decode `n` from the input format.
2. Determine the largest power of two `p` with `p <= n` by repeated doubling.
3. Compute the survivor as `2 * (n - p) + 1`, the closed form of the Josephus problem for step size `2`.

Complexity is `O(log n)` per test case with constant memory.
