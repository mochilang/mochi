# [Aggressive cows](https://www.spoj.com/problems/AGGRCOW/)

## Problem Summary
Given positions of N stalls and C cows, place the cows into stalls so that the minimum pairwise distance is maximized. Output the largest possible minimum distance.

## Algorithm
1. **Read** the stall positions and sort them in ascending order.
2. **Binary search** on the answer `d` â€“ the minimal distance between adjacent cows:
   - For a candidate distance, greedily place cows from left to right, always choosing the earliest stall at least `d` away from the last placed cow.
   - If all cows can be placed, the candidate distance is feasible; otherwise, it's too large.
3. The search range is from `0` to the difference between the furthest and closest stall. The final `d` that passes is the result.

Sorting dominates with `O(N log N)` time per test case; the feasibility check is `O(N)`, so the overall complexity is `O(N log N)`.
