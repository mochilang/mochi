## Problem Summary
Given the page counts of `m` booklets and `s` schools, Bob must distribute the booklets so that the first `r = m % s` schools receive `ceil(m/s)` booklets each and the remaining schools receive `floor(m/s)` booklets. Booklets given to earlier schools must not have more pages than those given to later schools, and within each school the original order of booklets must be preserved. For a specified school `k` (0-indexed), report the number of pages in the first booklet delivered to that school.

## Algorithm
1. Pair every booklet with its original position.
2. Sort these pairs by page count ascending, breaking ties by original index.
3. Let `base = m / s` and `r = m % s`. The first `r` schools obtain `base + 1` booklets each; the rest obtain `base`.
4. Compute the slice of the sorted list belonging to school `k` using the above sizes.
5. Within that slice, find the booklet with the smallest original indexâ€”the page count of this booklet is the result.

Sorting ensures earlier schools receive no larger booklets than later ones, while keeping the smallest original index simulates the first booklet Bob hands out in that school. The approach runs in `O(m log m)` time with sorting (sufficient for `m < 3000`).
