## Problem Summary
Given a list of booklet page counts and a number of schools, distribute the booklets so that:
- Each school receives either \(\lceil n/k \rceil\) or \(\lfloor n/k \rfloor\) booklets.
- All schools receiving the larger number (UIP) are served before those receiving the smaller number (LIP).
- Booklets given to earlier schools must have pages \(\le\) those given to later schools.
- Within each school, booklets keep their original relative order from the input list.

For a specified school index (0-based), output the number of pages of the first booklet delivered to that school.

## Algorithm
1. Read all booklets, storing each with its page count and original position.
2. Sort the booklets by page count (ascending), breaking ties by original index to keep stability.
3. Let `base = n / k` and `extra = n % k`. The first `extra` schools receive `base + 1` booklets, the rest `base`.
4. Traverse the sorted list assigning groups in this order. For the target school, find the booklet in its group with the smallest original index; its page count is the answer.

The insertion sort runs in \(O(n^2)\) time, which is fine for `n < 3000`.
