## Problem Summary
Given up to 100 cities connected by up to 10,000 directed roads, each road has a length and a toll cost. Bob wants to travel from city 1 to city N using roads so that the total toll does not exceed K coins while minimizing the total length. For each test case output the minimal possible length or `-1` if it's impossible within budget.

## Algorithm
1. Read the toll limit `K`, number of cities `N` and roads `R`.
2. Build an adjacency list where each road stores `(destination, length, toll)`.
3. Use Dijkstra's algorithm with an expanded state `(city, tollSpent)`:
   - Maintain `dist[city][toll]` = minimal length to reach `city` spending exactly `toll` coins.
   - Start with `dist[1][0] = 0` in a min-heap prioritised by path length.
   - When visiting a state, relax outgoing edges: if taking a road keeps total toll `<= K` and improves the distance, push the new state into the heap.
4. After processing, answer is the minimum `dist[N][t]` for `0 ≤ t ≤ K`; if none is finite return `-1`.

This runs in `O((N*K + R*K) log(N*K))`, which is feasible for the given limits (`N ≤ 100`, `K ≤ 10000`).
