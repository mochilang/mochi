## Problem Summary
Receipts are thrown into a ballot box throughout each day of a promotion. At day's end, the highest and lowest receipt values are removed. The customer with the highest receipt wins the difference between the two amounts. Both receipts are discarded. Given all receipts for each day, compute the total payout over the entire promotion.

## Algorithm
1. Maintain a multiset of all receipts using two heaps:
   - a max-heap for retrieving the current largest value,
   - a min-heap for retrieving the smallest.
   A map of counts keeps track of how many times each value is present.
2. For each day:
   - Insert each day's receipts into both heaps and increment counts.
   - Pop from the max-heap until a value with a positive count appears; this is the largest receipt. Decrement its count.
   - Pop from the min-heap until a value with a positive count appears; this is the smallest receipt. Decrement its count.
   - Add the difference `(largest - smallest)` to the running total.
3. After processing all days, output the total payout.

Heaps ensure each insertion and removal is `O(log n)`, allowing up to `10^6` receipts to be processed efficiently.
