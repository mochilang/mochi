# [Triangle Partitioning](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TRIPART)

## Problem Summary
Given the side lengths `a`, `b`, and `c` of a triangle, repeatedly split every triangle by drawing the median on its longest side. Each split creates two smaller triangles. Among all triangles generated by this infinite process, count how many distinct similarity classes ("styles") occur. Two triangles are of the same style if their side ratios are identical.

## Algorithm
Operate on squared side lengths to avoid square roots. Represent each triangle by the sorted triple of squared side lengths and normalise it by dividing by the greatest common divisor so triangles with the same ratios yield the same triple.

Use a breadth‑first search starting from the initial triangle `(a^2, b^2, c^2)`. For a triangle with sorted squared sides `x ≤ y ≤ z`:

1. The squared length of the median to the longest side is `m^2 = (2x + 2y - z) / 4`.
2. Splitting produces two triangles with squared side sets `{x, m^2, z/4}` and `{y, m^2, z/4}`.
3. Multiply all three values by `4` to keep integers, giving `[4x, 2x + 2y - z, z]` and `[4y, 2x + 2y - z, z]`.

Normalise each resulting triple and enqueue any unseen styles. The search finishes when no new styles appear; the number of collected styles is the answer.

This method runs quickly because the number of distinct styles is small (less than 100 in the judge's tests) and all computations use integer arithmetic.
