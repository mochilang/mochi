# SPOJ HISTOGRA - Largest Rectangle in a Histogram

The input describes a histogram as `n` bars of unit width with heights `h1..hn`.
For each histogram we must output the area of the largest rectangle that can be
placed within it and shares the base line.

## Algorithm

We process each histogram using a stack of indices representing an increasing
sequence of bar heights:

1. Iterate through all bars `i` from `0` to `n`.
2. While the stack is non-empty and the current height is smaller than the
   height at the top index, pop the top.  The popped bar forms a rectangle with
   height `h[top]` and width determined by the distance between the current
   index and the new stack top (or `i` if the stack becomes empty).  Update the
   maximum area.
3. Push the current index onto the stack and continue.
4. After the loop, repeat the popping step with `i = n` to process remaining
   bars.

This maintains each bar in the stack at most once, giving `O(n)` time per test
case and `O(n)` additional space.
