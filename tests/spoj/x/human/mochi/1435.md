## Problem Summary
Given an unweighted, undirected tree with up to 100000 nodes, find the size of the smallest set of vertices such that every edge has at least one endpoint in the set.

## Algorithm
1. Build adjacency lists for all nodes.
2. Run an iterative depth-first search from an arbitrary root to record parent relationships and a processing order.
3. Process nodes in reverse order computing two DP values:
   - `take[v]` = 1 + sum(min(`take[u]`, `leave[u]`)) for every child `u`.
   - `leave[v]` = sum(`take[u]`) for every child `u`.
4. The answer is `min(take[root], leave[root])`.

## Complexity
The DFS and DP each visit every edge once, giving **O(N)** time and **O(N)** memory.
