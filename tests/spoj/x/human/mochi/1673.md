## Problem Summary
Given `K` daily salaries `a_i`, they are redefined as
`b_i = a_i + 2 a_{i-1} + 2^2 a_{i-2} + ... + 2^{i-1} a_1`.
For a target amount `N`, choose a set of days whose new salaries `b_i`
add up to exactly `N`.

## Solution Approach
1. Compute each `b_i` iteratively using the recurrence `b_i = a_i + 2*b_{i-1}`.
   Each `b_i` is greater than the sum of all previous `b_j` values,
   forming a super-increasing sequence.
2. Because of this property, subset selection can be done greedily:
   traverse days from `K` down to `1`, taking day `i` whenever `b_i <= N`
   and subtracting it from the remaining target.
3. If the remaining target becomes zero after processing all days,
   output the selected indices in increasing order; otherwise, output `-1`.

## Complexity
- Time: `O(K)` per test case.
- Space: `O(K)` to store the `b_i` values.
