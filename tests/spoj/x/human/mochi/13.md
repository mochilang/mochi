# SPOJ 13 - Hotline

This simplified solution stores basic affirmative facts and can answer
only yes/no questions about them.

For a statement of the form:
```
<subject> <verb>s <object>.
```
it records the triple `(subject, verb, object)` in a map.

For a question of the form:
```
does <subject> <verb> <object>?
```
the program checks whether the triple exists:

* if present, it prints `yes, <subject> <verb>s <object>.`
* otherwise it prints `maybe.`

Lines ending with an exclamation mark terminate the dialogue and are
printed verbatim.
