# PLATON - Platon and Socrates

[Problem statement](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PLATON/)

## Algorithm

For a given range `[l, r]` consider all pairs of distinct numbers `a < b`.
The classic Sum and Product logic from the dialogue is applied step by step:

1. **Initial pairs:** generate all pairs and compute their sums and products.
2. **Product ambiguity:** remove pairs whose product occurs only once.  This
   models Platon's first statement that he does not know the numbers.
3. **Sum ambiguity:** for each remaining sum keep only sums that correspond to
   more than one pair.  Socrates knew the product would be ambiguous and still
   cannot decide after hearing Platon.
4. **Product certainty:** from these, keep pairs whose product appears only once.
   After Socrates' remark Platon can now deduce the pair.
5. **Sum certainty:** finally keep sums that also appear only once so that
   Socrates can determine the numbers as well.
6. Sort the resulting pairs by increasing sum and output them.

This procedure yields exactly the pairs consistent with the entire dialogue.
