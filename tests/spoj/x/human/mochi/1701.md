# SPOJ EOWAMRT - Earth Observation with a Mobile Robot Team

Robots move in the plane with piecewise linear routes. When two robots are within distance `R`, they instantly share all data. Initially only the first robot has data and we must list every robot that knows it by time `T`.

## Algorithm

1. Parse all robots. For each robot store the times when the velocity changes and the velocity of each interval.
2. For every pair of robots merge their time segments. On each interval both robots move with constant velocities.  Using the relative motion we form a quadratic `a*t^2+b*t+c` for the squared distance and solve it to find the subintervals where the distance is `<= R`.
3. Build a table of contact intervals between every pair.
4. Propagate the information.  Keep the earliest time each robot learns the data and repeatedly pick the robot with the minimal time not processed yet. For each neighbour, find the first contact interval whose end is after this time and update the neighbour time with the beginning of that interval (or the current time if it is inside the interval).
5. All robots with time `<= T` have received the data.  Output their nicknames in dictionary order.

The number of robots is at most 100 and each travel route has at most 1000 units of time, so the quadratic solving for all pairs is feasible.  Propagation is `O(N^2)`.
