# [Cylinder](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CYLINDER/)

## Problem Summary
Given the width `w` and height `h` of a rectangular sheet of paper (`1 ≤ w ≤ h ≤ 100`), split it horizontally. Cut the largest possible circle from the top part as the base of a cylinder, and roll the remaining part to form the side surface so that its perimeter matches the circle's circumference (overlap allowed). For each `(w, h)` pair, output the maximum volume of a cylinder that can be made. Terminate on `0 0` and round results to three decimal places.

## Algorithm
1. Ensure `w ≤ h` by swapping if necessary.
2. **Option 1 – circumference from width:**
   - `r1 = w / (2π)`
   - `h1 = h - 2r1`
   - `v1 = π * r1^2 * h1`
3. **Option 2 – circumference from remaining height:**
   - `r2 = min(w / 2, h / (2(π + 1)))`
   - `v2 = π * r2^2 * w`
4. The best volume is `max(v1, v2)`.
5. Print the result rounded to three decimals.

## Complexity
O(1) per test case.
