## Problem Summary
Given several cylindrical pies (height 1) with various radii and F friends, find the maximum possible volume of equally-sized pieces such that everyone (F friends plus yourself) receives one piece from a single pie.

## Algorithm
1. Compute the volume of each pie: \(v_i = \pi r_i^2\).
2. Binary search the answer volume V in range [0, max(v_i)].
   - For each mid V, sum \(\lfloor v_i / V \rfloor\) over all pies to count how many pieces can be obtained.
   - If the count is at least F+1, V is feasible; move lower bound up. Otherwise, move upper bound down.
   - Iterate ~50 times for sufficient precision.
3. Output the final lower bound formatted to four decimal places.

This approach runs in \(O(N \log 10)\) per test case with constant extra memory.
