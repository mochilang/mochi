## Problem Summary
Read integers from standard input and print each one on its own line until the value `42` is encountered. After reading `42`, terminate without printing it or any subsequent numbers.

## Algorithm
1. Loop reading lines from input.
2. Convert the line to an integer.
3. If the integer is `42`, break the loop.
4. Otherwise, print the line unchanged.

The procedure runs in O(n) time for n numbers and uses constant extra space.
