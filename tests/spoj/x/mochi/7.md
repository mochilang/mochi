# [The Bulk](https://www.spoj.com/problems/BULK/)

## Problem Summary
Given the polygonal faces of a solid built from unit cubes, determine how many unit cubes form the solid. Each test case lists every face of the solid, where each face is an orthogonal polygon lying in a plane parallel to one of the coordinate planes.

## Algorithm
1. Read all faces and track the maximum coordinate.
2. For each face, mark every unit square it covers on a 3‑D grid according to whether the face lies in an `x`, `y`, or `z` plane.
3. Perform a 3‑D flood fill starting from an exterior cell, using the marked faces as barriers, to measure outside volume.
4. Subtract the outside volume from the total bounding box volume to obtain the number of unit cubes comprising the bulk and print the result.

This approach runs in time proportional to the grid volume determined by the input coordinates and uses additional memory proportional to that grid.
