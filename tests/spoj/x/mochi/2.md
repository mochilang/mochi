# [PRIME1 - Prime Generator](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PRIME1)

## Algorithm

1. **Precompute primes up to 32,000** using the classic sieve of Eratosthenes.
   - This covers all primes up to âˆš1e9, the maximum possible upper bound.
2. **For each test case [m, n]:**
   - Create a boolean array representing the interval `[m, n]`, initially all true.
   - For each precomputed prime `p`:
     - Stop if `p*p > n`.
     - Find the first multiple of `p` within `[m, n]` and mark all its multiples as composite.
   - Special-case `m = 1` to mark 1 as non-prime.
3. **Output** every index still marked prime.
   - Separate test cases with a blank line.

This is the segmented sieve method, which keeps memory usage low when generating primes for ranges up to one million numbers.
