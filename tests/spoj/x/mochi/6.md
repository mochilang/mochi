## Problem Summary
Given two positive integers (each up to 500 digits) and an operator `+`, `-`, or `*`, output the arithmetic operation in the same vertical format used in manual calculations. Addition and subtraction show the result under a horizontal line. Multiplication also lists partial products for each digit of the second number; if that number has more than one digit, the partial products are followed by another horizontal line and the final sum. Digits of all numbers are right‑aligned and lines contain the minimal necessary leading spaces. A blank line follows each test case.

## Algorithm
1. **Parse the expression** into operands `a`, `b` and operator `op`.
2. **Big integer operations** are implemented on strings:
   - `add_str` performs digitwise addition with carry.
   - `sub_str` performs digitwise subtraction with borrow (`a ≥ b`).
   - `mul_str` multiplies `a` by each digit of `b`, collecting partial products and the final sum.
3. **Determine output width** as the maximum length among `a`, `op+b`, the final result and every partial product including its shift.
4. **Print lines**:
   - First operand right‑aligned to width.
   - Operator with second operand right‑aligned.
   - A line of dashes covering the longer of the second line or first partial product / result.
   - For multiplication with multi‑digit `b`, each partial product is aligned so its last digit lines up with the corresponding digit of `b`, followed by another dash line.
   - Final result right‑aligned.
   - Print an empty line after each test case.

The digit‑wise operations run in `O(n)` time for addition/subtraction and `O(n·m)` for multiplication (`n`, `m` being operand lengths), satisfying the constraints.
