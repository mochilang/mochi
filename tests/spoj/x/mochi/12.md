# [MMIND - The Game of Master-Mind](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MMIND/)

## Algorithm

We perform a depth-first search constructing the secret code position by position.
For each guess we track the number of exact matches (black pegs) and total color
matches.  When any guess violates its hints or cannot possibly reach them with
the remaining positions, the branch is pruned.  Colours are tried in ascending
order so the first complete solution is the lexicographically smallest.
