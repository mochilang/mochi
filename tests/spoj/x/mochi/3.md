# Substring Check (Bug Funny)

[Problem statement on SPOJ](https://www.spoj.com/problems/SBSTR1)

## Algorithm

We are given two binary strings `A` (length 10) and `B` (length 5). For each pair we must output `1` if `B` appears as a contiguous substring of `A`, otherwise `0`.

Since `A` is short, a simple linear scan suffices:

1. If `A` is shorter than `B`, return `0`.
2. Compare the prefix of `A` with `B`; if equal, return `1`.
3. Recursively apply the check on `A` without its first character.

This effectively slides a window of length `|B|` across `A` and stops once a match is found. The recursion depth is at most `|A|` (10), so it is efficient.

## Sample

Input
```
1010110010 10110
1110111011 10011
```
Output
```
1
0
```
