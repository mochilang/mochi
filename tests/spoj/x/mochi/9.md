# SPOJ Problem 9: Direct Visibility

[Problem statement](https://www.spoj.com/problems/DIRVS/)

## Algorithm

1. Precompute for every cell whether BTS1 or BTS2 is visible using a 3D grid
   traversal (Amanatides-Woo) from the cell to each BTS. A cell is blocked if the
   ray intersects a terrain cube.
2. Run a BFS from BTS1 to BTS2 over the grid. Movement to a neighbour is allowed
   only if the height difference is at most +1 upward and at most -3 downward
   and the destination cell has visibility to at least one BTS.
3. The BFS distance at BTS2 is the shortest number of steps. If unreachable,
   output `Mission impossible!`.
