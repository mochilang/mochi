## Problem Summary
Read integers from standard input and echo them to output until the sentinel value `42` is encountered. Upon reading `42`, terminate without printing it or any subsequent numbers.

## Algorithm
1. Repeatedly read a line using `input()`.
2. Convert the line to an integer with `int()`.
3. If the integer is `42`, break the loop.
4. Otherwise, print the original line.

This approach operates in linear time relative to the number of values read and uses constant additional memory.
