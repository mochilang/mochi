# [Complete the Sequence!](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CMPLS)

## Problem Summary
Given the first `S` terms of a sequence, extend it by `C` values assuming the
sequence is generated by a polynomial of minimal degree that fits the provided
terms. Output the next `C` values of the sequence.

## Algorithm
1. Build a forward difference table from the initial sequence until the last
   row becomes constant. For a sequence defined by a degree-`d` polynomial, the
   `d`-th differences are constant.
2. For each of the `C` required values:
   - Append the same constant to the bottom row.
   - Working upwards, append to each higher row the sum of its last value and
     the new value from the row below.
3. The newly appended values in the first row are the desired continuation of
   the sequence.

This method simulates polynomial extrapolation via finite differences.
It runs in `O(S * C)` time with at most `S` rows in the table and `C` extension
steps.
