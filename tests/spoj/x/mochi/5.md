# SPOJ Problem 5: The Next Palindrome

[Problem statement](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PALIN/)

## Algorithm

1. Read the number as a string and split it into a list of digits.
2. If all digits are `9`, the answer is `1` followed by `len(digits)-1` zeros and a trailing `1`.
3. Otherwise mirror the left half onto the right half.
4. If the mirrored number is not strictly larger than the input, propagate a carry from the middle to the left while mirroring to the right.
5. Convert the digit list back to a string and print it.
