## Problem Summary
For each test case, given two integers \(m\) and \(n\) with \(1 \le m \le n \le 10^9\) and \(n-m \le 100000\), output all prime numbers in the inclusive range \([m,n]\). Separate the output for consecutive test cases with a blank line.

## Algorithm
1. Precompute all prime numbers up to 100000 using the classic sieve of Eratosthenes. This covers all primes up to the square root of the maximum possible \(n\) (\(\sqrt{10^9} < 31623\)).
2. For each test case:
   - Clamp \(m\) to at least 2 because primes are >= 2.
   - Create a boolean array representing the range \([m,n]\); initially assume all numbers are prime.
   - For each precomputed prime \(p\):
     - Stop if \(p^2 > n\).
     - Find the first multiple of \(p\) within \([m,n]\). Start from \(p^2\) if it lies within the range to avoid redundant marking.
     - Mark every multiple of \(p\) in the range as composite.
   - Output every number in the range that remains unmarked.
3. Print a blank line between successive test cases.

This is the segmented sieve technique. For each test case it runs in \(O((n-m+1) \log \log n)\) time and uses \(O(n-m+1)\) extra space.
