## Problem Summary
Given up to 1000 arithmetic expressions involving non-negative integers up to 500 digits, perform addition, subtraction, or multiplication and print the operands and results formatted like manual arithmetic. For multiplication by multi-digit numbers, print each partial product aligned with the corresponding digit, followed by their sum. Each test case is separated by a blank line.

## Algorithm
1. Parse the expression to identify operands `A`, `B` and operator `op`.
2. Use `math/big` to compute the result `C` of `A op B`.
3. For addition and subtraction:
   - Compute `width = max(len(A), len(op+B), len(C))`.
   - Print `A`, `op+B`, a dash line of length `max(len(op+B), len(C))`, and `C`, each right-aligned to `width`.
4. For multiplication:
   - For each digit of `B` from least significant to most, compute the partial product `P` as `A * digit` (or `0` if digit is zero) and record its shift (digit position).
   - Determine `width = max(len(A), len(op+B), len(C), max(len(P)+shift))` and `lineLen = max(len(op+B), len(first partial))`.
   - Print `A`, `op+B`, and the first dash line (`lineLen` dashes) right-aligned to `width`.
   - If `B` has multiple digits, print each partial product right-aligned with its digit (`width - shift - len(P)` leading spaces), then print a full-width dash line and the final result right-aligned.
5. After each test case, output a blank line.

The operations run in `O(n)` time for numbers with `n` digits and require `O(n)` extra space.
