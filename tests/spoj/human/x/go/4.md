# [Transform the Expression](https://www.spoj.com/problems/ONP/)

## Problem Summary
Given algebraic expressions containing lowercase letters, binary operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`, and parentheses, convert each expression to its Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) form.

## Algorithm
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each expression:
   - Iterate through characters:
     - If the character is a letter, append it directly to the output.
     - If it is `(`, push it onto the operator stack.
     - If it is `)`, pop operators from the stack to the output until `(` is encountered.
     - If it is an operator, pop operators from the stack with higher precedence or with the same precedence (except when the current operator is `^`, which is right associative), then push the current operator.
   - After processing all characters, pop remaining operators from the stack to the output.
3. Output each converted expression on its own line.

The algorithm runs in linear time relative to the length of the input expression and uses a stack to manage operators.
