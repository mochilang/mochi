# [Complete the Sequence!](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CMPLS)

## Problem Summary
Given the first `S` terms of a sequence, extend it by `C` values assuming the
sequence is generated by a polynomial of minimal degree fitting the provided
terms. Output the next `C` values.

## Algorithm
1. Build a forward difference table from the initial sequence until the last
   row becomes constant. For a sequence defined by a degree-`d` polynomial, the
   `d`-th differences are constant.
2. For each of the `C` required values:
   - Append the same constant to the bottom row.
   - Work upwards, appending to each higher row the sum of its last value and
     the new value from the row below.
3. The newly appended values in the first row form the continuation of the
   sequence.

This method performs polynomial extrapolation via finite differences and runs
in `O(S * C)` time using at most `S` rows in the table.
