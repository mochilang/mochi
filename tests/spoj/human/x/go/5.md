# [The Next Palindrome](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PALIN)

## Problem Summary
Given a positive integer `K` with up to one million digits, find the smallest palindrome larger than `K`.

## Algorithm
1. Read `K` as a byte slice.
2. If all digits are '9', return `1` followed by `n-1` zeros and ending with `1`.
3. Otherwise, compare mirrored halves to decide if the left side is smaller than the right.
4. Mirror the left half onto the right to form a palindrome.
5. If the mirrored number is not greater than `K`, increment the middle digit(s) and propagate the carry leftward, mirroring after each change.
6. Print the resulting slice as the next palindrome.

The algorithm processes each number in linear time with respect to its length and uses linear extra memory.
