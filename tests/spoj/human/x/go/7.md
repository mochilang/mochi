# [The Bulk!](https://www.spoj.com/problems/BULK)

## Problem Summary
Given the descriptions of several bulks, each built from unit cubes, determine how many cubes form each bulk.  Every bulk is described by all of its faces.  Faces are polygons with axis-aligned edges and lie in planes parallel to the coordinate axes.  Bulks may contain hollow regions but are always fully enclosed and connected.

## Algorithm
1. Parse all faces, collecting every x, y and z coordinate used.  Add bounding values 0 and 1001 to cover the exterior space.
2. Keep only faces perpendicular to the x‑axis; these are used for ray casting.  Store their polygons projected onto the yz‑plane.
3. Compress the coordinate lists and iterate over every cell formed by consecutive x, y and z coordinates.
4. For each cell, take its center and cast a ray in the +x direction.  Count how many stored faces lie ahead and contain the point (y, z) in their polygon.  A standard even‑odd rule (ray casting) test determines containment.
5. If the count of intersections is odd, the cell lies inside the bulk.  Add its volume (Δx·Δy·Δz) to the total.
6. After processing all cells, output the accumulated volume.

Coordinate compression keeps the number of cells manageable, and ray casting correctly handles complex shapes and holes.
