## Problem Summary
Given coordinates of several friends on a city grid, choose a friend's home for the meeting so that the total walking distance (Manhattan distance) from all friends to that home is minimized. Report this minimal total distance for each test case.

## Algorithm
1. For all friends, collect their \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates separately.
2. For each dimension independently:
   - Pair each coordinate with its original index and sort the pairs by coordinate value.
   - Build prefix sums over the sorted values.
   - For each position \(i\) with value \(v\), compute the total distance to all other values using
     \(v \cdot i - \text{prefix}[i-1]\) for those on the left and
     \((\text{prefix}[n-1]-\text{prefix}[i]) - v \cdot (n-1-i)\) for those on the right.
   - Store this distance for the original index.
3. For every friend index \(k\), the total walking distance is `sumX[k] + sumY[k]`.
4. Output the smallest total among all friends.

Sorting dominates the runtime, yielding \(O(n \log n)\) time and \(O(n)\) extra space per test case.
