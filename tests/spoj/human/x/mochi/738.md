# [Another Counting Problem](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TREE/)

## Problem Summary
Given integers `n` and `d`, count the number of strictly n-ary trees of depth exactly `d`. A strictly n-ary tree is one where each internal node has exactly `n` children. Depth is the maximum number of edges from the root to any leaf. Input ends with `0 0`.

## Algorithm
1. Let `F(k)` be the number of strictly n-ary trees whose depth is at most `k`.
2. Recurrence: `F(0) = 1` (single node). For `k > 0`, each tree is either a single node or a root with `n` subtrees of depth ≤ `k-1`, giving `F(k) = 1 + F(k-1)^n`.
3. Trees with depth exactly `d` are `F(d) - F(d-1)`.
4. Compute `F(k)` iteratively up to `d` using big integers and the above recurrence, then output `n d F(d)-F(d-1)`.

The constraints (`n ≤ 32`, `d ≤ 16`) keep the exponent small; big integers handle the large counts.
