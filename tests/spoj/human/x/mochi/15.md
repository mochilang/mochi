## Problem Summary
Given a set of cities connected by directed roads with positive costs, for several queries we must output the minimum transportation cost between two named cities.

## Algorithm
1. Read the city graph: store each city's neighbors and map city names to indices.
2. For every query, run Dijkstra's algorithm from the source index using arrays for distances and visited flags.
3. Repeatedly select the unvisited node with the smallest distance, relax its outgoing edges, and stop once the destination is finalized.
4. Output the distance found for each query.

This simple array-based Dijkstra runs in O(n^2 + m) time per query and is sufficient for the given limits.
