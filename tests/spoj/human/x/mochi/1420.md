# Geometry and a Square

[https://www.spoj.com/problems/GEOM/](https://www.spoj.com/problems/GEOM/)

Given the center of an axis-aligned square, its side length, and a point \(P\), draw four lines:
- from vertex \(A\) perpendicular to line \(BP\)
- from vertex \(B\) perpendicular to line \(CP\)
- from vertex \(C\) perpendicular to line \(DP\)
- from vertex \(D\) perpendicular to line \(AP\)

Determine whether the four lines meet at one point and, if so, output the intersection.

## Algorithm
1. Compute coordinates of vertices \(A,B,C,D\) using the square center and half of the side length.
2. For each vertex construct a direction vector perpendicular to the segment from the next vertex to \(P\).
3. For every pair of these lines, compute their intersection using the cross product formula.  
   The intersection of lines through points \(p, q\) with direction vectors \(r, s\) is:
   \[ t = \frac{(q-p)\times s}{r\times s}, \quad p + t r \]
4. Check whether the found intersection lies on all four lines (cross product close to zero).
5. If such a point exists, output `YES` and its coordinates rounded to one decimal place; otherwise output `NO`.

This approach runs in constant time per test case.
