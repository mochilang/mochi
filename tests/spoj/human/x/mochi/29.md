# [Hash it!](https://www.spoj.com/problems/HASHIT/)

## Problem Summary
Maintain a hash table of 101 slots that stores string keys (up to 15 letters).
For each test case, process up to 1000 operations of the form `ADD:key` or
`DEL:key`. The hash function is

`hash(key) = (19 * sum_{i=1..n} ASCII(key[i]) * i) mod 101`.

Collisions are resolved by probing indices
`(hash + j^2 + 23*j) mod 101` for `j = 0..19`.  Ignore attempts to insert
a key that already exists and deletions of absent keys.  After all operations,
output the number of stored keys and each `index:key` pair in ascending index
order.

## Algorithm
1. Implement `ord` to convert letters and `_` to their ASCII codes.
2. Compute `hash(key)` using the given formula.
3. To search for a key, probe up to 20 positions using the quadratic sequence.
4. For `ADD`, first check whether the key already exists; if not, insert it at
   the first empty probed slot.
5. For `DEL`, locate the key using probing and mark the slot as empty.
6. After processing all operations, count and print non-empty slots followed by
each `index:key` pair sorted by index.

This approach keeps operations `O(1)` on average while following the specified
probing strategy.
