# IMAGE - Image Perimeters

Given a grid of `.` and `X`, a click selects the object containing that `X`. An object is the set of `X` cells connected by 8-neighbour adjacency. We must print the perimeter of this object.

## Algorithm
1. Repeatedly read `r c sr sc` until all four are zero.
2. Read `r` lines for the grid.
3. Perform a BFS from `(sr-1, sc-1)` over 8 directions to mark all `X` cells in the object.
4. For every visited cell, inspect its four orthogonal neighbours. Each missing or non-`X` neighbour contributes 1 to the perimeter.
5. After traversal, output the accumulated perimeter.

This visits each cell at most once so the complexity is `O(r*c)` per test case with `O(r*c)` memory for the queue and visited set.
