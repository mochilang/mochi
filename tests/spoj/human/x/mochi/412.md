# SPOJ COVER - K-path cover

Split each vertex into left and right copies. For every edge u->v, add an edge from left(u) to right(v) with cost equal to the sum of the costs of the two vertices. Add source edges to all left copies and edges from all right copies to a sink with capacity one to ensure each vertex appears at most once as start or end.

Run min-cost max-flow to send exactly k units of flow. Each unit corresponds to one edge in the cover. If we cannot push k units, output `NONE`; otherwise, the total flow cost is the minimal cost of a k-path cover. SPFA is used for shortest paths since edge costs may be negative.
