# [Java vs C ++](https://www.spoj.com/problems/JAVAC/)

## Problem Summary
Given an identifier, determine whether it's written in Java's camelCase or C++'s snake_case, convert it to the other style, or output `Error!` if it matches neither convention.

## Algorithm
1. **Validate identifier**
   - Reject if it starts or ends with an underscore, begins with an uppercase letter, or contains `__`.
   - While scanning, record whether underscores or uppercase letters appear; having both is invalid.
2. **Determine style**
   - If underscores were seen, treat as C++: remove each underscore and capitalize the next letter.
   - Else if uppercase letters were seen, treat as Java: insert `_` before each uppercase letter and lowercase it.
   - Otherwise the identifier is a single lowercase word and is printed unchanged.

Each identifier is processed in `O(n)` time with `O(1)` additional memory.
