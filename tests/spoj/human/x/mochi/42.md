# [Adding Reversed Numbers](https://www.spoj.com/problems/ADDREV/)

## Problem Summary
Add two numbers where each number is given in reversed decimal form. Reverse both numbers, add them, then output the reverse of the sum without leading zeros.

## Algorithm
1. For each number, read its digits from right to left while skipping leading zeros to obtain the reversed integer.
2. Add the two reversed integers.
3. Reverse the digits of the sum by repeatedly taking the last digit.
4. Print the reversed sum.

Each test case runs in O(length of numbers).
