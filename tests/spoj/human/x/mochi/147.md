# [Tautology](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TAUT/)

## Problem Summary
Given a logical expression in prefix notation using operators:
- `C` – conjunction (and)
- `D` – disjunction (or)
- `I` – implication
- `E` – equivalence
- `N` – negation

Variables are lowercase letters. For each expression, determine whether it is always true regardless of variable assignments.

## Algorithm
1. Extract the set of distinct variables appearing in the expression.
2. Enumerate all `2^n` assignments for these variables (`n ≤ 16`).
3. For each assignment evaluate the expression by scanning it from right to left:
   - Push variable values on a stack.
   - On `N` negate the top of the stack.
   - For `C`, `D`, `I`, `E` pop the two top values, compute the operator result, and push it back.
4. If any assignment evaluates to false, the expression is not a tautology; otherwise it is.

This brute-force search is feasible because of the small variable limit and expression length (≤ 111 characters).
