## Problem Summary
Given up to 100 cities connected by up to 10,000 directed roads, each road has a length and a toll. For each test case we know a maximum amount of coins `K`. Find the minimum total length of a path from city 1 to city N whose total toll does not exceed `K`. If no such path exists output `-1`.

## Algorithm
1. Build an adjacency list for the directed roads.
2. Use Dijkstra's algorithm on an expanded state `(city, cost)`:
   - `dist[city][cost]` stores the minimum length to reach `city` spending exactly `cost` coins.
   - A min-heap ordered by length explores states with smallest current distance.
   - From each state relax outgoing edges, adding the edge length and toll when the new total cost is at most `K`.
3. The first time a state for city `N` is popped we have the optimal answer. If the destination is never reached, return `-1`.

The state space is `N * (K+1)` (â‰¤ 1e6) and each relaxation uses the priority queue, so the solution runs efficiently within the limits.
