# SPOJ PPATH - Prime Path

[Problem link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PPATH/)

We are given pairs of four-digit prime numbers.  You may change one digit at a time and every intermediate number must remain a prime.  The task is to find the minimum number of digit changes needed to transform the first prime into the second.

## Algorithm

1. **Prime generation** – Precompute all primes between 1000 and 9999 using the sieve of Eratosthenes.
2. **Breadth-first search** – For each test case perform BFS starting from the first prime.
   - From the current number generate neighbours by changing each of its four digits to `0..9` (first digit cannot be `0`).
   - Only consider candidates that are four-digit primes and not yet visited.
   - Each edge has cost `1`; BFS yields the shortest number of steps.
3. If the target prime is reached output the distance, otherwise output `Impossible`.

The complexity per test case is `O(P)` where `P` is the number of four-digit primes (at most 1229) since each prime is visited at most once.
