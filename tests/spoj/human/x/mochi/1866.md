# [Making Pals](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MKPALS/)

## Problem Summary
Given a string of up to six decimal digits, we may insert or delete digits at either end, each operation costing one, to obtain a palindrome. For multiple input sequences, output the minimal cost and length of the resulting palindrome, preferring longer palindromes when costs tie.

## Algorithm
1. Perform a breadth‑first search over strings reachable by edits.
2. Start with the original sequence and repeatedly apply all allowed operations:
   - delete the first or last digit,
   - add any digit `0`–`9` to the left or right.
   Avoid revisiting strings already explored.
3. After processing each cost level, check all strings; if any are palindromes, report the smallest cost and the maximum length among them.

Because the search space expands quickly but the initial sequence has at most six digits, this BFS finds the optimal cost and length almost instantly.
