# [How to pack containers](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CONTPACK/)

## Problem Summary
Given boxes of various sizes and values, and a set of containers whose sizes are powers of two, determine whether all containers can be tightly packed with the available boxes. If it is possible, output the minimal total value of goods used; otherwise output "No".

## Algorithm
1. **Sort boxes by value.**  Each box has size `s` (height `2^s`) and value `v`.
2. **Iteratively add boxes:** keep counts `boxCnt[s]` for chosen boxes.
3. **Feasibility check after each addition:**
   - Copy `boxCnt` into a working array `avail`.
   - For every size `i = 0 … 1000`:
       * If `avail[i] < contCnt[i]` (required containers), packing fails.
       * Use `contCnt[i]` boxes; pair leftover boxes to create `leftover/2` boxes of size `i+1`.
   - If all sizes succeed, the current prefix of boxes can pack all containers.
4. The first prefix passing the check yields the minimal total value because boxes were processed in increasing value. Sum their values and output the result.
5. If no prefix works, print `No`.

## Complexity
Let `n` be the number of boxes (≤ 10000) and `S` the maximum size (≤ 1000). Sorting costs `O(n log n)`. The feasibility test is `O(S)` and is run at most `n` times, so the total complexity is about `O(n log n + n·S)` (~10⁷ operations).
