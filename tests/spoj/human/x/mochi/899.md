## Problem Summary
Given a line with keys \(k_1, k_2, k_3\) and a second line with an encrypted string, decrypt the message. Letters are partitioned into three groups: `a`–`i`, `j`–`r`, and `s`–`z` plus underscore. Within each group the characters were rotated left by the corresponding key during encryption. The input ends when all three keys are zero.

## Algorithm
1. Convert the message to an array of characters and record the indices belonging to each of the three groups.
2. For each group, rotate the collected characters right by the given key (modulo the group length) and write them back to their recorded positions.
3. Join all characters to form the decrypted string and print it.

This processes each message in linear time with respect to its length.
