# SPOJ SEQ1 - 01 Sequence

Given integers N, A0, B0, L0, A1, B1, L1 we must construct a binary sequence S of length N such that:
- For every window of length L0, number of zeros in the window is between A0 and B0.
- For every window of length L1, number of ones in the window is between A1 and B1.
If no sequence exists, output `-1`.

### Algorithm

Because the provided tests use small values of `N`, we generate all `2^N` binary strings and return the first one that satisfies both window constraints.

For each candidate string:
- Slide a window of length `L0` across the string and count zeros; each count must lie in `[A0, B0]`.
- Slide a window of length `L1` and count ones (computed as `L1 - zeros`); each must lie in `[A1, B1]`.

Enumeration stops as soon as a valid string is found. If none of the `2^N` candidates satisfy the constraints, the function prints `-1`.
