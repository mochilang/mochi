# [The Long and Narrow Maze](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MAZE/)

## Problem Summary
Given a 3×n grid of square tiles. Each tile is of type 0 (empty), 1 (straight pipe) or 2 (bent pipe). Every tile may be rotated by multiples of 90°. Decide whether it is possible to orient the tiles so that a continuous passage connects the left edge of the grid with the right edge.

## Algorithm
Perform a breadth‑first search on the grid. A state is a cell together with the direction from which the path enters it (left, right, up, down).

- For a type 1 tile the exit is forced to be the opposite side of the entry (left↔right or up↔down).
- For a type 2 tile the exit must be one of the two sides adjacent to the entry side (turning 90°).
- Type 0 tiles have no passages and cannot be used.

From the starting column (column 0) enqueue all rows that are not type 0, entering from the left. Explore possible exits and enqueue reachable neighbour cells if they are not visited for that entry direction. If we ever leave the grid to the right of the last column, a solution exists.

The BFS considers at most `3 * n * 4` states, giving O(n) time and memory.
