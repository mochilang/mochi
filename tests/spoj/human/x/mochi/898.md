# [Transmitters](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TRANSMIT/)

## Problem Summary
A transmitter at position `(x, y)` broadcasts within a semicircle of radius `r` that can be rotated freely but not moved. Given `n` points, determine the maximum number that can lie inside the semicircle for some rotation. Input ends when a negative radius is provided.

## Algorithm
1. **Filter Points** – For each point, check if its squared distance from the transmitter is at most `r^2`. Ignore points outside the circle.
2. **Compute Angles** – For the remaining points, compute their polar angle using an `atan2` approximation.
3. **Sort Angles** – Sort the angles and duplicate the list with each angle plus `2π` to handle wrap-around.
4. **Sliding Window** – Use two pointers to find the maximum number of angles within any interval of width `π`.
5. Output the maximum count for each test case.

This algorithm runs in `O(m log m)` time dominated by sorting `m` in-range points (with insertion sort `O(m^2)` but `m ≤ 150`), and `O(m)` memory.
