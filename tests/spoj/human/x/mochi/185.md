## Problem Summary
Two players move on a triangle-free undirected graph. In each turn, player A moves first (to an adjacent vertex or staying), then player B moves similarly. B tries to land on the same vertex as A; A tries to avoid it. Given starting positions, decide if B can guarantee to catch A and, if so, compute the minimal number of turns assuming optimal play from both.

## Algorithm
1. Build the graph and detect which vertices belong to cycles. Iteratively remove all vertices with degree ≤1; the remaining vertices form the cycle set.
2. Compute shortest distances `distA` and `distB` from A and B to every vertex using BFS.
3. If there exists a cycle vertex `v` with `distA[v] < distB[v]`, player A can reach that cycle strictly earlier and evade forever ⇒ output `No`.
4. Otherwise, B will eventually catch A. The worst case for B is when A heads towards a vertex reachable no earlier than B. The capture time is `max(distB[a], max_{v : distB[v] ≤ distA[v]} distB[v])`.

The approach runs in `O(n + m)` time per test case.
