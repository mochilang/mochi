## Problem Summary
Simulate a tiny text editor that processes input line by line. The character `d` duplicates the entire current line, while any other character is appended. Input ends on an empty line, after which all processed lines are printed.

## Algorithm
1. Repeatedly read a line from input.
2. If the line is empty, stop reading.
3. Initialize an empty string `res` and iterate over characters of the line:
   - If the character is `d`, set `res = res + res` (duplicate current content).
   - Otherwise append the character to `res`.
4. After processing, output `res`.

The per-line runtime is proportional to the resulting line length (bounded by 150 characters).
