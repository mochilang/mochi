## Problem Summary
We are given two alphabetically-sorted lists of two-word phrases: the first list in
language A and the second list containing their translations in language B, but the
correspondence between the phrases is lost.  Each distinct word has a unique
translation and there is a unique solution.  For each test case we must recover
all word-to-word translations and print them in alphabetical order of the language A
words.  Input ends with `0`.

## Algorithm
1. Read the `n` phrases for both languages and build two directed graphs:
   vertices are words and edges are phrase pairs (`u -> v`).
2. Record in-degree and out-degree for each word in each language.
3. Perform a depth-first search assigning words in language A to words in language B:
   - Vertices are considered in decreasing order of total degree.
   - A candidate mapping is only tried if in/out-degrees match and the already
     assigned neighbours satisfy the edge relations in both directions.
4. Once a full bijection is found, create the list of word translations and sort it
   lexicographically by the language A word.
5. Output each pair as `word1/word2`, with a blank line between consecutive test cases.

This backtracking search is feasible because at most 25 distinct words occur, and
pruning by degree and edge consistency quickly isolates the unique mapping.
