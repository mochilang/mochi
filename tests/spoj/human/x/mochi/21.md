# [Triangle From Centroid](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TRICENTR/)

## Problem Summary
Given the length of side `a` of a triangle and the distances from its centroid to each side (`d_a`, `d_b`, `d_c`), compute the triangle's area and the distance from the orthocenter to the centroid.

## Algorithm
1. The altitude to side `a` is `h_a = 3*d_a`; the area is `A = a*h_a/2 = 1.5 * a * d_a`.
2. Recover the other sides using altitudes `h_b = 3*d_b`, `h_c = 3*d_c`:
   - `b = 2*A / h_b`
   - `c = 2*A / h_c`
3. Compute the circumradius `R = a*b*c / (4*A)`.
4. Distance from centroid to circumcenter: `OG^2 = R^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)/9`.
5. Distance from orthocenter to centroid: `GH = 2*sqrt(max(0, OG^2))`.
6. Output `A` and `GH`, rounded to three decimal places.

The algorithm uses constant time per test case and only basic arithmetic.
