# MUL - Fast Multiplication

[Problem statement](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MUL/)

## Algorithm
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case read a line containing two decimal numbers `a` and `b`.
3. Parse both numbers as arbitrary-precision integers (`bigint`).
4. Output the product `a * b`.

## Correctness
Casting the input strings to `bigint` yields exact representations of the given numbers.
Multiplying two `bigint` values computes their exact product, so the printed value for each
case equals the result of the multiplication of `a` and `b`.

## Complexity Analysis
Let `n` and `m` be the number of digits of `a` and `b` respectively. The built-in `bigint`
multiplication runs in `O(n * m)` time using schoolbook arithmetic, and uses `O(n + m)` space.
