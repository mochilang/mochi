# [EQBOX - Equipment Box](https://www.spoj.com/problems/EQBOX/)

Given a tile of size `A × B` and a box of size `X × Y`, determine if the box can
be placed on a single tile without touching tile borders. The box may be
rotated at any angle.

## Algorithm

1. Reorder the dimensions so that `A ≥ B` and `X ≥ Y`.
2. If `Y ≥ B`, the shorter side of the box cannot fit vertically, so escaping is
   impossible.
3. If `X < A`, the unrotated box fits.
4. Otherwise, compute the minimal possible width when the height is constrained
   to `B`:
   * Let `S = X² + Y²`.
   * If `S ≤ B²`, the box's diagonal fits vertically and the minimal width is `Y`.
   * Else compute
     * `s = √(S - B²)`
     * `c = (B·Y + X·s) / S`
     * `st = (B - Y·c) / X`
     * `width = X·c + Y·st`
5. The box fits if `width < A`.

All arithmetic uses floating-point square roots via Newton's method.

This approach runs in constant time per test case.
