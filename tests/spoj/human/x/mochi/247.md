## Problem Summary
Given an `m Ã— n` chocolate bar, each potential vertical cut `x[i]` and horizontal cut `y[j]` has a cost. Cutting along a line splits one piece into two and incurs its line's cost multiplied by the number of pieces it crosses. Determine the minimum total cost to break the bar into individual squares.

## Algorithm
1. Read all vertical and horizontal cut costs.
2. Sort both cost lists in **descending** order.
3. Maintain counts of current vertical pieces and horizontal pieces (initially 1 each).
4. Repeatedly take the largest remaining cut:
   - If the next vertical cost is greater, cut vertically and pay `cost *= horizontal pieces`.
   - Otherwise cut horizontally and pay `cost *= vertical pieces`.
   - Increase the corresponding piece count.
5. After one list is exhausted, apply remaining cuts of the other orientation with the current piece count.

This greedy strategy ensures expensive cuts are performed when they affect the fewest segments.

## Complexity
Sorting takes `O((m+n) log (m+n))` and processing the cuts is `O(m+n)`.
