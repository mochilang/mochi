# [Up Subsequence](https://www.spoj.com/problems/UPSUB/)

## Problem Summary
Given a string `x` (length up to 100), output all maximal upsubsequences—i.e. all longest non-decreasing subsequences—in lexicographical order for each test case.

## Algorithm
1. For each index `i` of the string, compute the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence starting at `i`:
   - Traverse indices from right to left.
   - `dp[i] = 1 + max(dp[j])` over `j > i` with `x[j] >= x[i]` (or 1 if none).
   - Track the overall maximum length `L`.
2. Enumerate all subsequences of length `L` using depth-first search:
   - Start from positions where `dp[i] == L`.
   - When moving from `i` to `j`, require `j > i`, `x[j] >= x[i]` and `dp[j] == dp[i]-1`.
   - Collect resulting strings when `dp[i] == 1`, using a map to avoid duplicates.
3. Sort the collected subsequences lexicographically and print each, followed by a blank line after every test case.

This runs in `O(n^2 + k log k)` time per test case, where `n` ≤ 100 and `k` is the number of maximal subsequences, using `O(n)` additional space.
