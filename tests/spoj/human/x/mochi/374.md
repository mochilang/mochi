# [Count maximum matrices](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MATRIX/)

## Problem Summary
We are given a binary matrix. For any submatrix, count ones and zeros along its border and define the value as `ones - zeros`. Among all submatrices, find the maximum value `W` and the number `S` of submatrices with value `W`.

## Algorithm
See explanation in `tests/spoj/x/human/mochi/374.md`.
