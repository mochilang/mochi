# [Printer Queue](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PQUEUE/)

## Problem Summary
Given the priorities of print jobs in a queue and the index of your job, simulate the printer that always prints the highest-priority job at the front. If a job at the front has a lower priority than some job in the queue, it is moved to the back. Determine how many jobs are printed until your job is printed.

## Algorithm
1. For each test case read `n` and the position `m` of the target job, followed by the list of `n` priorities.
2. Simulate the queue:
   - While true, take the first job and find the maximum priority in the current queue.
   - If the first job has the maximum priority, it is printed. Increment elapsed time and decrease `m`; if `m` becomes `-1`, output the elapsed time.
   - Otherwise move the first job to the end of the queue and update `m` accordingly (`m = m - 1`, wrapping to `len(q)-1` when negative).
3. Repeat until the target job is printed.

This direct simulation runs in at most `O(n^2)` time for each test case (`n â‰¤ 100`), which is easily fast enough.
