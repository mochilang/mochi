# [Convex Hull 3D](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CH3D/)

## Algorithm
1. **Initial Tetrahedron**: Pick four non-coplanar points and orient their faces so that the normals point outward. Compute an interior point as the centroid of these four points.
2. **Incremental Hull**: For each remaining point, find all faces visible from it (positive signed distance). Remove those faces and collect their boundary edges. Edges shared by two removed faces cancel out, leaving the horizon.
3. **Add Faces**: Connect each horizon edge to the new point to create new faces, orienting them using the interior point.
4. **Area & Volume**: After processing all points, sum over all valid triangular faces:
   - Surface area: half the norm of the cross product of two edges.
   - Volume: oriented tetrahedron volume `dot(a, cross(b, c)) / 6`.

This algorithm runs in \(O(n^2)\) for up to 1000 points.
