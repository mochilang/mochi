## Problem Summary
Given the number of cities `n` and a string describing the direction of travel between consecutive cities around a circular waterway (`A` anticlockwise, `B` both directions, `C` clockwise), determine the minimum number of circular channels required so that every allowed direction between adjacent cities is represented without two channels sharing an arc.

## Algorithm
1. Each one-way segment (`A` or `C`) requires its own dedicated channel. There are `n` segments, so `n` channels are always needed.
2. If any segment allows travel in both directions (`B`), one extra channel is required to separate the opposite flows on at least one arc. Thus the answer becomes `n + 1`.
3. Scan the description string; if it contains `B`, output `n + 1`, otherwise output `n`.

This runs in O(n) time per test case.
