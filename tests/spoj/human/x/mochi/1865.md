# [Making Waves](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MKWAVES/)

## Problem Summary
Given a discrete signal composed of two unit-amplitude sine waves,
`sin(f1*t) + sin(f2*t)`, where `f1` and `f2` are distinct integers between
400 and 600 Hz, we receive `N` samples taken at times `t = k/N` for `k = 1..N`.
The task is to recover the two original frequencies.

## Algorithm
1. Pre-compute `sin(f * k / N)` in degrees (converted to radians) for every
   candidate frequency `f` in `[400,600]` and each sample index `k`.
2. For every pair `f1 < f2` in this range, compute the squared error between
   the given samples and `sin(f1*k/N) + sin(f2*k/N)` using the precomputed
   values.
3. Track the pair with minimal error and report the two frequencies in
   ascending order.

The search over 201 frequencies requires evaluating about twenty thousand
pairs. With sine values precomputed, the per-case complexity is roughly
`O(200^2 * N)` which is fast for `N â‰¤ 1000`.
