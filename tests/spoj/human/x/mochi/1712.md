## Problem Summary
Given a lowercase word `W` (length ≤ 30), consider all distinct permutations of its letters, sorted lexicographically.
For each input line output the 1‑based position of `W` in this ordering. Inputs are separated by blank lines and terminated by `#`.

## Algorithm
1. **Precompute factorials** `fact[i] = i!` for `0 ≤ i ≤ 30` using big integers.
2. **Count permutations of a multiset:** For letter frequencies `freq[0..25]`, the number of distinct permutations is
   `total! / ∏ freq[i]!` where `total` is the sum of all frequencies.
3. **Rank a word:**
   - Build the frequency array of its letters.
   - For each position `i` in the word:
     - For every letter `j` smaller than the current letter with a positive remaining frequency,
       temporarily decrement `freq[j]` and add `countPerm(freq)` to the rank.
     - Decrement the frequency of the actual letter and continue.
   - Start the rank at `1` because the first permutation has rank 1.
4. **Output** the rank right‑justified in a field of width 10. Blank input lines produce blank output lines.

## Correctness
Step 2 computes the number of unique permutations obtainable from any multiset of letters.
During step 3, for each position we enumerate all lexicographically smaller choices by summing the permutations
possible when a smaller letter is placed at that position. After processing all positions the accumulated count plus one
is exactly the position of the word among all sorted permutations.

## Complexity Analysis
Let `n` be the word length (≤ 30). For each of the `n` positions we examine at most 26 letters and compute a permutation
count over 26 frequencies. All big‑integer operations involve numbers ≤ 2¹³¹. Thus the time complexity is `O(26·n)` and the
extra space used is `O(26)`.
