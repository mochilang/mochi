# [Greedy Hydra](https://www.spoj.com/problems/DRAGON/)

## Problem Summary
Given a tree with N fruits and weighted branches, choose exactly K fruits (including fruit 1) for the boss. Branches connecting fruits placed in different groups are cut and their weights add to the hydra's illness. The remaining fruits form the other group. Minimize the total illness or report `-1` if the selection is impossible.

## Algorithm
1. Root the tree at fruit 1.
2. For each node `u` compute `dp[u][k]`: minimal illness inside `u`'s subtree when `k` fruits are chosen from that subtree and `u` itself is chosen.
3. Process children using knapsack merging:
   - Selecting `0` fruits from a child cuts the connecting branch and adds its weight.
   - Selecting `x>0` fruits keeps the branch and adds `dp[child][x]`.
4. After merging all children, `dp[u]` holds minimal costs for all selection counts.
5. The answer is `dp[1][K]` (or `-1` if unreachable).

This dynamic programming runs in O(N·K²) time for N ≤ 300.
