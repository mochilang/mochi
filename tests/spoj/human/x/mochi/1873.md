# [Accumulate Cargo](https://www.spoj.com/problems/ACARGO/)

## Problem Summary
Given `N` unit-weight boxes placed at distinct integer positions on a circular
conveyor belt of length `L`, we may rotate the belt freely. Holding one end of a
contiguous luggage while the belt rotates moves all cargo behind it one position
per second and costs the weight of the held luggage per second. We need the
minimal total cost to group all cargo into a single consecutive luggage.

## Algorithm
1. Read and sort all box positions.
2. For each gap between consecutive positions (subtracting one for the box
   size), compute its length.
3. The cost to close a gap equals the gap length multiplied by the minimum
   number of boxes on either side of the gap.
4. Sum these costs for all gaps. The wrap-around gap after the last position
   has zero cost because one side is empty.

The complexity is `O(N log N)` due to sorting.
