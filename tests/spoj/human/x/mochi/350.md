## Problem Summary
Given a profile of `N` elevations and a limit `K`, remove the smallest total volume of earth (only lowering is allowed) so that the resulting landscape contains at most `K` peaks. A peak is a contiguous block of equal elevations that is higher than its neighbors or borders.

## Algorithm
1. **Single Peak Cost**: For every subarray `[l, r]`, compute the minimal cost to turn it into exactly one peak. For each possible peak position `m` in `[l, r]`, keep its height and sweep left and right, lowering elements that exceed the last height seen. The minimum over all `m` gives `cost[l][r]`.
2. **Dynamic Programming**: Let `dp[k][i]` be the minimal cost to convert prefix `a[0..i]` into exactly `k` peaks.
   - `dp[1][i] = cost[0][i]`.
   - For `k > 1`, `dp[k][i] = min_{p < i} dp[k-1][p] + cost[p+1][i]`.
3. **Answer**: `min_{1 \le k \le K} dp[k][N-1]`.

This approach runs in `O(N^3 + K N^2)` time for general inputs (constraints `N â‰¤ 1000`, `K â‰¤ 25`).
