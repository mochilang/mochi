# [The lightest language](https://www.spoj.com/problems/LITELANG/)

## Problem Summary
Given `n` and an alphabet of `k` letters with individual weights, find the minimal total weight of a prefixless language of `n` words. A word's weight is the sum of its letters' weights. The language must be prefix-free.

## Algorithm
1. Use a min-heap to store candidate leaves in the prefix tree, starting with a single node of weight `0` (empty prefix).
2. While the number of leaves is less than `n`:
   - Pop the smallest weight `x` from the heap.
   - Replace it with its `k` children: for each letter weight `w[i]`, push `x + w[i]` into the heap.
   - This increases the number of leaves by `k - 1`.
3. Once at least `n` leaves exist, pop the smallest `n` weights from the heap and sum them. This sum is the minimal total weight.

This greedy expansion always replaces the cheapest leaf, ensuring minimal overall weight. The complexity is `O(n log n)`.
