## Problem Summary
You are given ten encoded addition equations. For each test case, an integer `n (<=21)` is provided followed by three strings of length `n` using the first `n` capital letters. Replacing each distinct letter by a digit `0..n-1` forms base-`n` numbers where the sum of the first two equals the third. Every letter maps to a unique digit and the mapping is a permutation of `0..n-1`.

## Algorithm
We solve each puzzle via depthâ€‘first search on the addition from the least significant position to the most significant.

1. Maintain a mapping from letters to digits and a set of used digits.
2. Recursively process columns starting from the rightmost index with a carry value (0 or 1).
3. At each column, if a letter is unassigned, try assigning any unused digit and recurse on the same column.
4. Once both addends' letters are assigned, determine the required digit for the result column and propagate the carry to the next position. Ensure uniqueness of digit assignments when assigning the result letter.
5. The recursion succeeds when all positions are processed and the final carry is zero.

This backtracking approach quickly finds the unique permutation for each test case.
