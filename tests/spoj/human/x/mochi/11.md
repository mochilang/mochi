## Problem Summary
Given a number `N`, compute the number of trailing zeros in `N!` (factorial of `N`). Multiple queries are given.

## Algorithm
1. For each `N`, repeatedly divide `N` by 5, adding the quotient to a running total.
2. Multiply the divisor by 5 each iteration until it exceeds `N`.
3. The total count is the number of trailing zeros in `N!`.

This works because each trailing zero comes from a factor pair of 2 and 5; the number of 2s exceeds 5s in `N!`, so counting factors of 5 suffices.

The algorithm runs in `O(log_5 N)` time per query with `O(1)` extra space.
