## Problem Summary
Given a number `N`, compute the number of trailing zeros in `N!` (factorial of `N`). Multiple queries are given.

## Algorithm
1. Initialise `d = 5` and `count = 0`.
2. While `d <= N`:
   - add `N / d` to `count` (integer division)
   - multiply `d` by `5`
3. The loop effectively computes `sum_{k \ge 1} \lfloor N / 5^k \rfloor`,
   which is the number of trailing zeros in `N!`.

Each trailing zero is created by a factor pair `2 * 5`. Since factorials
contain more factors of `2` than `5`, counting only the powers of `5`
is sufficient. The algorithm runs in `O(log_5 N)` time per query with
`O(1)` extra space.
