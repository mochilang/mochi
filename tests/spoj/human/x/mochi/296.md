# TWORK - Teamwork is Crucial

We are given a graph where each vertex represents a scientist and edges represent direct acquaintances. Each scientist has degree 2 or 3 and we must form workgroups of three scientists such that within each group there exists a leader accepted by all members. A scientist accepts either themselves or one of their direct acquaintances as leader. Therefore a valid group must contain a scientist connected to the other two members.

The solution reads the graph and greedily forms groups. Scientists are processed in numerical order. For each unassigned scientist we gather its unused neighbors. If at least two unused neighbors exist, we form a group consisting of the scientist and the first two such neighbors and mark all three as used. This guarantees the first scientist in the group is adjacent to the other two and can serve as the leader.

Any remaining scientists that cannot be grouped are left unassigned. The sample input results in two groups: `1 2 3` and `4 6 8`, covering 75% of scientists which satisfies the requirement that no more than 25% are left unassigned.
