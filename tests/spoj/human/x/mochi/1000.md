## Problem Summary
Given an `n × n` grid split into `n` labelled regions, determine whether each region forms a single contiguous area.  The input lists cell coordinates for the first `n−1` regions; all unspecified cells belong to the last region.  For each test case output `good` if every region is contiguous, otherwise output `wrong`.

## Algorithm
1. Read `n` and initialise an `n × n` grid filled with zeroes.
2. For each region `1 … n−1`, read a line of coordinate pairs and assign those cells to the region.  Afterward, mark all remaining cells as region `n`.
3. For each region `r`:
   - Find a starting cell and perform a breadth‑first search over four directions, visiting only cells labelled `r`.
   - After the BFS, verify that no cell of region `r` remains unvisited. If any do, the partition is invalid.
4. If all regions pass the connectivity test print `good`; otherwise print `wrong`.

## Complexity
For grids with `n ≤ 99`, each BFS touches at most `n²` cells and is executed `n` times.  The total time is `O(n³)` (≲10⁶ operations) and the memory usage is `O(n²)`.
