## Problem Summary
Given two different integers inside a range \([l, r]\), one player learns their product and the other learns their sum. They publicly exchange the statements:

1. Product-holder: "I don't know the numbers."
2. Sum-holder: "I knew you wouldn't know. I don't know either."
3. Product-holder: "Now I know."
4. Sum-holder: "I know it too."

For each test case we must list all pairs \((a,b)\) within \([l, r]\) that satisfy this dialogue. Pairs are printed in increasing sum order.

## Algorithm
For each test case (range size < 200):

1. **Enumerate pairs** \((x,y)\) with \(l \le x < y \le r\). Store them both by product and by sum.
2. **Ambiguous products:** mark a product as ambiguous if it has more than one factor pair in the range. This encodes statement 1.
3. **Good sums:** a sum is *good* if it has at least two pairs and every pair's product is ambiguous. These sums satisfy statement 2.
4. **Unique products after statement 2:** for each ambiguous product, filter its factor pairs to those whose sum is good. If only one pair remains, that pair is determined by the product-holder after statement 2 (statement 3).
5. **Final pairs:** for each good sum, keep the unique pair whose product was determined in step 4. If exactly one such pair exists, it is a valid solution (statement 4).
6. **Sort** resulting pairs by increasing sum (and then by first element) and output.

The enumeration is \(O(k^2)\) for at most 200 numbers, making the method efficient.
