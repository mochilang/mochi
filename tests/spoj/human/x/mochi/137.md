## Problem Summary
Given integers \(m\), \(n\), and \(k\), list the lexicographically \(k\)-th nondecreasing sequence of \(n\) positive integers whose sum equals \(m\).

## Algorithm
1. Define `count(m, n, min)` as the number of partitions of `m` into `n` parts where each part is at least `min`.
   - If `n == 0`, return `1` when `m == 0` else `0`.
   - For each `i` from `min` to `floor(m/n)` add `count(m - i, n - 1, i)`.
   - Use memoization to store previously computed states.
2. To build the `k`-th partition, iterate possible values for each position starting from the minimal allowed value.
   - For value `i`, compute `c = count(m - i, n - 1, i)`.
   - If `k > c`, decrement `k` by `c` and continue with the next `i`.
   - Otherwise append `i` and recurse with updated `m`, `n`, and `k`.
3. Output the constructed sequence separated by spaces.

## Complexity
The memoization table spans states with `m ≤ 220`, `n ≤ 10`, and `min ≤ 220`, totalling under a million states.
Each state is computed once, resulting in feasible time and memory for the given constraints.
