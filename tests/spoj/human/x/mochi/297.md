# [Aggressive cows](https://www.spoj.com/problems/AGGRCOW/)

## Problem Summary
Given positions of N stalls and C cows, place the cows so that the minimum distance between any two cows is as large as possible.

## Algorithm
1. Sort stall positions in ascending order.
2. Binary search the largest minimum distance `d`:
   - Starting with the first stall, greedily place each subsequent cow in the earliest stall at least `d` away from the last cow.
   - If we can place all cows, `d` is feasible; otherwise it's too large.
3. Output the greatest `d` that succeeds.

This approach runs in `O(N log N)` time per test case due to sorting and the binary search with linear checks.
