# [Tin Cutter](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TCUTTER/)

## Problem Summary
Given up to 100 axis-aligned segment cuts inside a tin plate, determine how many holes remain after performing all cuts. Each cut is defined by its two endpoints. The input consists of multiple test cases terminated by `0`.

## Algorithm
1. **Collect vertices.** Start with endpoints of every segment. For every pair of segments, insert intersection points: vertical–horizontal crossings and overlapping portions of collinear segments.
2. **Build edges.** For each segment, gather all collected points lying on it, sort them along the segment, and create edges between consecutive points. Deduplicate edges.
3. **Count components.** Use a disjoint-set union (Union-Find) on the vertices using the edges to determine the number of connected components `C`.
4. **Apply Euler's formula.** The number of holes equals `E - V + C`, where `V` is the number of unique vertices and `E` the number of unique edges.

This runs in `O(N^2)` time due to pairwise intersection checks, which is sufficient for `N ≤ 100`.
