# The Bytelandian Cryptographer (Act IV)

[SPOJ Problem](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CRYPTO4)

The message is encoded using a Vigenère cipher with an unknown key length `n` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ m`).
Given partially known plaintext `x` and ciphertext `y`, both consisting of capital letters or `*`, we
reconstruct characters of `x` that are forced by the data.

## Algorithm

1. For every position where both `x[i]` and `y[i]` are known, compute the shift
   `diff[i] = (y_i - x_i) mod 26`.
2. For each candidate `n` from `1` to `m` verify consistency: all indices congruent
   modulo `n` must share the same shift.  Keep the key values for valid `n`.
3. For each valid `n` compute a candidate plaintext:
   - Known characters remain unchanged.
   - If `x[i]` is `*` but `y[i]` and the corresponding key value are known, decrypt
     `x[i]` from `y[i]`.
   - Otherwise the character is unknown (`*`).
4. Merge candidate plaintexts: a position is determined only if every candidate
   agrees on the same letter; otherwise we output `*`.

This approach explores all feasible key lengths and uses intersections to find
letters that can be uniquely reconstructed.
