# [Angels and Devils](https://www.spoj.com/problems/ANGELS/)

## Problem Summary
Given an X × Y grid with cells marked as:
- **H**: heavenly and vacant (transparent walls).
- **A**: heavenly but occupied by an angel (opaque walls).
- **D**: devil's room (transparent, unusable).

Place fighters on **H** cells so that no two fighters can see each other horizontally or vertically through transparent rooms. Angels block visibility.

## Algorithm
1. Split each row into horizontal segments separated by angels and assign an ID to each segment.
2. Do the same for columns to obtain vertical segment IDs.
3. For every **H** cell, add an edge between its row-segment ID and column-segment ID, forming a bipartite graph.
4. Use DFS-based augmenting paths to compute a maximum bipartite matching.
5. The matching size equals the maximum fighters that can be placed.

The segmentation and matching take \(O(XY)\) time with up to 300×300 grids.
