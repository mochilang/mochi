# SPOJ BAC - Bacterial

Problem: https://www.spoj.com/problems/BAC/

Given a rectangular plate and several bacterial samples at
integer coordinates, each sample expands uniformly in all
directions. A point on the plate belongs to the sample whose
center is closest in Euclidean distance; once two samples meet
they stop expanding into each other's area. For every test case we
must compute the area dominated by each sample inside the
rectangle and report the samples sorted by decreasing area.

## Algorithm
1. For every sample *i*, start with the whole rectangle as its
   candidate region represented as a polygon.
2. For each other sample *j*, compute the perpendicular bisector
   line of *i* and *j*. Keep only the half‑plane containing *i* by
   clipping the polygon with this line (Sutherland–Hodgman half‑plane
   clipping).
3. After processing all other samples, compute the polygon's area
   using the shoelace formula. This gives the region dominated by
   sample *i*.
4. Collect areas for all samples, sort the samples by area in
   descending order and output their identifiers (padded to three
   digits) together with the area formatted to two decimals in a
   14‑character field.

The number of samples is at most 100, so the overall complexity is
`O(n^2 * m)` where *m* is the number of polygon vertices, which is
small for this problem.
