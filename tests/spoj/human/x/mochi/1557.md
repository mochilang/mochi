# [Can you answer these queries II](https://www.spoj.com/problems/GSS2/)

## Problem Summary
We are given a list of problem scores (possibly negative).  For each query `[X, Y]`,
Amber may choose a contiguous block of problems inside this interval.  When Yang Zhe
solves the chosen block, he attempts the problems in order but if a score value
appears multiple times, only its first occurrence contributes to the total.
Find the maximum total score he can obtain for each query.

## Algorithm
For every query:
1. Iterate over every possible starting index `i` in `[X, Y]`.
2. For each start, extend the end index `j` from `i` to `Y` while maintaining a set
   of scores already seen.
   - When encountering a new score, add it to the running sum.
   - Track the maximum sum reached for any prefix of this block.
3. The answer for the query is the largest sum encountered (the empty block yields `0`).

This brute-force approach runs in `O((Y-X+1)^2)` time per query, which suffices for
small examples.
