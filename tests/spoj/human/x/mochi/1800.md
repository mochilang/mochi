## Problem Summary
Given up to three team members with specified intelligence levels and up to ten problems, each describing how long it takes to solve depending on the member's brightness. A problem cannot be handled by members below its minimum requirement. All problems are submitted at time zero. We must assign problems to members and schedule them so that no member solves two problems at the same time and the average completion time is minimal. The output includes this minimal average time and a schedule listing when each problem starts and finishes on the assigned member.

## Algorithm
1. **Preprocess times** for each problem-member pair using the piecewise rules. If a member does not meet the minimum brightness, mark the pair as invalid.
2. **Enumerate assignments** of problems to members via recursion. With `m ≤ 3` and `n ≤ 10` there are at most `3^10` combinations. Skip invalid assignments.
3. **Evaluate cost** for each assignment:
   - For every member gather its jobs and sort them by duration (shortest processing time first).
   - Compute cumulative completion times of this order and sum them across all members.
4. Track the assignment with the smallest total completion time. Reconstruct the schedule by repeating the sorting step and computing start/end times for each job.
5. **Output** the case number, minimal average completion time (sum/n) with two decimals, and the schedule for all problems.

This exhaustive search is feasible under the small constraints and yields an optimal schedule.
