## Problem Summary
Concatenate the decimal representations of numbers from `1` to `N` and place `+` and `-` signs between adjacent digits alternately starting with `+`.  Evaluate the resulting expression.

## Algorithm
1. The value equals the sum of digits in odd positions minus the sum of digits in even positions of the concatenated string.
2. Precompute prefix values for complete blocks using the recurrence for `F(10^k-1)`.
3. For the block containing `N`, let `D` be the digit length of `N`:
   - **Even `D`** – every number starts with the same sign.  Use standard digit–sum formulas for each position and combine them with alternating signs.
   - **Odd `D`** – starting sign flips for consecutive numbers.  Compute digit sums weighted by `(-1)^i` using closed forms based on the periodicity of decimal digits.
4. Add the prefix contribution and the final block contribution to obtain the answer.

This runs in `O(log N)` time and `O(1)` memory per query.
