# [Barn Expansion](https://www.spoj.com/problems/EXPAND/)

## Problem Summary
Farmer John has up to 25,000 axis-aligned rectangular barns that never overlap but may touch along sides or at corners. A barn can be expanded only if none of its sides or corners touches another barn. For each test case, determine how many barns have room to expand.

## Algorithm
1. For each barn record its four boundary edges:
   - Vertical edges at `x = A` and `x = C` with y-interval `[B, D]`.
   - Horizontal edges at `y = B` and `y = D` with x-interval `[A, C]`.
2. Group vertical edges by their `x` coordinate and sort each group by starting `y`.
   Sweep through each group; if consecutive intervals overlap or touch, mark the corresponding barns as blocked.
3. Perform the same process for horizontal edges grouped by their `y` coordinate.
4. Count barns that were never marked as blocked; these are the expandable barns.

By sorting the edge groups, each comparison is localized, giving an overall `O(n log n)` time complexity for `n â‰¤ 25,000` barns.
