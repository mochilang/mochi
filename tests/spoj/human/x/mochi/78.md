# [Marbles](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MARBLES/)

## Problem Summary
Given \(n\) marbles and \(k\) colors, each color having an unlimited supply, count the number of ways to select exactly \(n\) marbles while taking at least one marble of every color. Marbles of the same color are indistinguishable.

## Algorithm
We need the number of integer solutions to
\(x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_k = n\) where each \(x_i \ge 1\).
Using the stars and bars combinatorial formula, the answer is:
\[
\binom{n-1}{k-1}
\]
To compute this efficiently within 64-bit limits:
1. Set \(r = \min(k-1, n-k)\) to reduce iterations.
2. Multiply sequentially: \(res = res * (n-1-r+i) / i\) for \(i=1..r\), using big integers to avoid overflow.

This runs in \(O(k)\) per test case and handles the given bounds.
