# HOSPITAL - Use of Hospital Facilities

## Algorithm

1. **Input Parsing**
   - Read hospital configuration: number of operating rooms, recovery beds, start hour, transport time, preparation times and number of patients.
   - For each patient read surname, surgery duration and recovery duration.

2. **Operating Room Scheduling**
   - Maintain an array with the next available time for each operating room, initialised to the start time.
   - For patients in roster order choose the operating room with the earliest available time (lower index to break ties).
   - Record the surgery start and end times and update the room's available time by adding the preparation time.

3. **Recovery Room Scheduling**
   - Sort patients by surgery end time (break ties by operating room number).
   - For each patient in that order compute arrival time to recovery (end of surgery + transport).
   - Assign the lowest numbered recovery bed whose preparation is finished by the arrival time and update the bed's available time.

4. **Statistics**
   - Track usage minutes for each operating room and recovery bed.
   - Available time is the interval from the first surgery start to the last patient leaving recovery.
   - Percentage utilisation = `used * 100 / total` rounded to two decimals.

5. **Output**
   - Print a table with each patient's operating room and recovery bed schedule.
   - Print a second table with utilisation statistics for all rooms and beds.

## Complexity

Let `P` be the number of patients, `R` the number of operating rooms and `B` the number of beds.
- Scheduling surgeries: `O(P * R)`
- Sorting patients by end time: `O(P^2)` (simple selection sort).
- Assigning recovery beds: `O(P * B)`
- Overall complexity is `O(P^2 + P*(R+B))` which is acceptable for `P â‰¤ 100`.
