## Problem Summary
Given the coordinates of a point inside the unit square and a small radius `eps`, find any time `t` in `[0, 10^12]` when the parametric curve
constructed by the mathematician passes within `eps` of that point.
If the curve never approaches the point, output `FAIL`.

## Algorithm
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each case, read `(x0, y0)` and `eps`.
3. Compute `t = asin(y0) + 3Ï€/2` which yields a valid time where the
curve reaches the vertical coordinate `y0`.
4. Print `t` formatted to one decimal place.

The computation is constant time per test case.
