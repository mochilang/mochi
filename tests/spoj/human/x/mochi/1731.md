# [Counting Triangles III](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TCOUNT3/)

## Problem Summary
Given T test cases, each containing an integer N describing the level of a hexagram formed by twelve level-N triangles, compute the total number of triangles contained in the hexagram.

## Algorithm
The hexagram can be viewed as the union of two large triangles of side length 3N. Counting all triangles in both and subtracting those lying in their intersection—a regular hexagon of side N—yields a closed-form formula. The resulting count of triangles for a given N is:

\[\text{triangles} = N \times (10N^2 + 9N + 1)\]

For each test case, compute this expression using 64‑bit arithmetic and output the result.

The computation for each N runs in constant time.
