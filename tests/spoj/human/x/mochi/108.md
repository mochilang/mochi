# [MORSE - Decoding Morse Sequences](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MORSE/)

Given a Morse code sequence and a dictionary of words, count how many
phrases can decode to the sequence using the dictionary words. The Morse
code for each letter is given; a word is represented by concatenating its
letters' codes. Multiple words may share the same Morse representation.

## Algorithm

1. Build a map from dictionary words to their Morse code strings and count
   how many words generate each Morse string. Also record the distinct
   lengths of these Morse strings.
2. Let `dp[i]` be the number of ways to parse the first `i` characters of the
   given sequence. Initialize `dp[0] = 1`.
3. For each position `i` in the sequence, if `dp[i] > 0` then for every
   length `L` recorded in step 1 check the substring `seq[i:i+L]`. If this
   substring matches a dictionary code, add `dp[i] * count` to `dp[i+L]`.
4. The answer is `dp[len(seq)]`.

This dynamic programming approach explores each position once and tries at
most the distinct Morse code lengths (max ~80), giving a complexity of
`O(n * L)` for a sequence of length `n`.
