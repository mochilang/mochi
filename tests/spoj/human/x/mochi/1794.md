# [Greedy Hydra II](https://www.spoj.com/problems/DRAGON2/)

## Problem Summary
Given a tree of N fruits where each edge has a weight, divide the tree into exactly M connected groups by removing M-1 edges.
The component containing fruit 1 (the biggest fruit) must contain at least K nodes.
The cost is the sum of weights of the removed edges; we want to minimize this cost or report -1 if no partition meets the constraints.

## Algorithm
1. Store all N-1 edges of the tree.
2. Enumerate every subset of edges (there are 2^(N-1) possibilities).
3. For each subset, treat the selected edges as removed:
   - Use a disjoint-set union to join nodes by the remaining edges.
    - Determine the number of components and the size of the component containing node 1.
    - If there are exactly M components and the root component has size at least K, track the cost of removed edges.
4. The minimal tracked cost is the answer; if no subset satisfies the constraints, output -1.

This brute-force approach suffices for small inputs such as the provided sample.
