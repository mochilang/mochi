# [Hares and Foxes](https://www.spoj.com/problems/HAREFOX/)

## Problem Summary
Given recurrence relations
\(h_{y+1} = a h_y - b f_y\) and \(f_{y+1} = c f_y + d h_y\), predict the
long-term behaviour of hare and fox populations starting from given values.
For each case output whether both populations approach the reference count,
diverge to $\pm\infty$ in various ways, or behave chaotically.

## Algorithm
1. Repeatedly apply the recurrence to update `(h, f)`.
2. Stop early if both values become very small (treated as reaching balance)
or if either value grows beyond a large threshold.
3. Track the sign of `h` and `f` once their magnitude exceeds a tiny
threshold. If a sign later changes, the system is considered chaotic.
4. After the loop:
   - If both values stayed near zero, report ecological balance.
   - If a sign flipped or no clear conclusion was reached, report chaos.
   - Otherwise map the final signs of `(h, f)` to the required sentence:
     * `(+,+)` → Both hares and foxes will overgrow.
     * `(-,+)` → Hares will die out while foxes will overgrow.
     * `(+,-)` → Hares will overgrow while foxes will die out.
     * `(-,-)` → Both hares and foxes will die out.

This simulation mirrors the behaviour dictated by the transformation's
eigenvalues without performing explicit eigenanalysis.
