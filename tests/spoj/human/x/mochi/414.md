# BONFIRE - Equatorial Bonfire

Link: https://www.spoj.com/problems/BONFIRE/

## Algorithm
1. For each test block read the spread speed `v`, number of bonfires `N` and the `N` pairs `(t_i, p_i)`.
2. Map each longitude `p_i` to `[0,360)` and sort bonfires by longitude.
3. Duplicate the arrays by appending each bonfire again at position `p_i + 360` to handle wrap‑around.
4. Perform two sweeps on the doubled list:
   - From left to right compute the earliest time each point can burn coming from the left.
   - From right to left do the same for burning from the right.
5. For each of the first `N` intervals between consecutive bonfires, find the meeting point of the two fronts and the time it burns. Keep the maximal time, breaking ties by smallest angle east of the zero meridian.
6. Convert the final angle back to `[-180,180]` and print time and angle with three decimal places.

## Complexity
Sorting the bonfires by longitude is `O(N^2)` via insertion sort (with `N ≤ 5000`). The sweeps and interval checks are linear, so the overall complexity is `O(N^2)` per test block.
