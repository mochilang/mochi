## Algorithm

The sequence enumerates all positive rationals along diagonals of the
integer grid.  Diagonal `k` contains `k` fractions and the cumulative count of
terms up to that diagonal is `T_k = k(k+1)/2`.

1. For a given term index `n`, find the smallest `k` such that `T_k ≥ n`.
   This locates the diagonal containing the term.
2. Let `pos = n - T_{k-1}` be the 1‑based position inside that diagonal.
3. If `k` is odd the diagonal is traversed from top to bottom: the numerator
   starts at `k` and decreases while the denominator increases.
   Otherwise it is traversed from bottom to top.
4. Form the fraction `(num, den)` according to the parity and print it in the
   format `TERM n IS num/den`.

## Complexity

Computing the diagonal takes `O(√ n)` time (since `k` grows with `√ n`) and
uses `O(1)` additional memory.
