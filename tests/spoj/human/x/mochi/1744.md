# [Evaluate the polynomial](https://www.spoj.com/problems/POLEVAL/)

## Problem Summary
Given a polynomial of degree `n` with coefficients `c_n` down to `c_0`, evaluate it at `k` integer points. Multiple test cases are provided until a line with `n = -1`.

## Algorithm
For each test case we read the coefficients in descending degree order and the `k` evaluation points.
For each point `x`, Horner's method evaluates the polynomial:
`res = ((c_n * x + c_{n-1}) * x + ... + c_1) * x + c_0`.
We print `Case i:` followed by the results for all `k` points.
The evaluation runs in `O(n)` time per point.
