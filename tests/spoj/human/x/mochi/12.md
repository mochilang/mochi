# [MMIND - The Game of Master-Mind](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MMIND/)

We must output a code consistent with previous guesses and their hints in the
Master‑Mind game.  Each hint reports:

- **B** – number of pegs with correct colour in the correct position,
- **W** – number of pegs with a correct colour but wrong position.

Given `P` (number of positions), `C` (number of colours) and `M` guesses with
hints, we need the lexicographically smallest code that fits all hints or the
sentence `You are cheating!` if none exists.

## Algorithm

We perform a depth‑first search building the code from left to right.  When we
try a colour for the current position we update, for every previous guess:

- `b` – black matches obtained so far,
- `m` – total colour matches (black + white) obtained so far.

A branch is pruned immediately when any guess cannot still meet its hint:

- `b` or `m` exceeds the hinted values, or
- even with all remaining positions we cannot reach the required `B` or `B+W`.

When all positions are assigned we accept the candidate only if all counters
exactly equal the hints.  Colours are attempted in ascending order, so the first
solution found is lexicographically smallest.  The search is feasible because
`P ≤ 10`.
