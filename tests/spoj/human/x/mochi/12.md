# [The Game of Master-Mind](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MMIND)

## Problem Summary
Given previous guesses and their black/white hints for a Master-Mind game, find the next guess that could be the secret code. If multiple codes satisfy all hints, output the lexicographically smallest; if none exist, print `You are cheating!`.

## Algorithm
- Parse the number of pins `P`, number of colours `C`, and the `M` prior guesses with their `(B, W)` hints.
- For each guess, precompute the frequency of each colour to allow quick colour-match calculations.
- Use depth‑first search over positions from left to right, trying colours `1..C` in order to naturally yield the lexicographically smallest code.
- While recursing, maintain for every guess:
  - `black`: count of exact matches seen so far.
  - `match`: count of positions whose colours appear in the guess (including blacks).
- After assigning a colour, update these counters and prune if any guess cannot still reach its required `B` or `B + W` with the remaining positions.
- Upon filling all positions, verify that each guess achieves exactly `B` blacks and `W` whites. If so, this assignment is the answer.
- If search finishes without a valid assignment, output `You are cheating!`.

## Complexity
The DFS has depth `P (≤10)` and up to `C (≤100)` branches per level, yielding `O(C^P)` worst-case time. Pruning by the hints greatly reduces the explored space. Memory usage is `O(C + M*P)` for frequency tables and tracking counts.
