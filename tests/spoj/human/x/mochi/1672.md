## Problem Summary
Given a rectangular park of size `M x N` with `K` axis-aligned rectangular carpets that block water, choose positions for `L` pipes. Water from a pipe spreads in four directions until it reaches a carpet or the park boundary. Determine the maximum total area that can be watered by placing up to `L` pipes.

## Algorithm
1. Collect all unique x- and y-coordinates from the park borders and carpet edges. Sort and deduplicate them to create a compressed grid of cells.
2. Mark grid cells covered by any carpet as blocked.
3. Perform BFS/DFS over unblocked cells to find connected components. The area of each cell is `(x[i+1]-x[i])*(y[j+1]-y[j])`; sum these areas per component.
4. Sort component areas in descending order and sum the largest `L` values.

This approach runs in `O(K^2 + W*H)` time where `W` and `H` are the numbers of unique x and y coordinates (â‰¤ 102), ensuring efficiency.
