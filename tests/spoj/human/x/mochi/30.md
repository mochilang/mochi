[Problem statement](https://www.spoj.com/problems/BLINNET/)

## Algorithm

We must connect all given cities with minimum total connection cost. This is exactly the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem on an undirected weighted graph.

For each test case:
1. Read the number of cities `n`.
2. Build an undirected graph. For each city we receive a list of neighbor indices and their connection costs. For each pair we add edges in both directions.
3. Run Prim's algorithm:
   - Maintain for every city the minimal cost to connect it to the growing tree and whether it is already included.
   - Initially the first city has cost `0` and all others have infinite cost.
   - Repeatedly choose the unused city with the smallest cost, add its cost to the answer and relax its neighbors' costs.
4. After `n` iterations the sum of chosen edge costs is the minimal cost of connecting all cities.

## Correctness

Prim's algorithm always produces a minimum spanning tree. At each step it adds the cheapest edge that connects a new city to the already built tree. Because every step adds the smallest available edge that doesn't create a cycle, the final set of edges connects all cities with the minimum possible total cost.

## Complexity Analysis

Let `n` be the number of cities and `m` the number of edges. The naive implementation scans all cities to select the next one, giving `O(n^2 + m)` time, which is adequate for the small tests. The memory usage is `O(n + m)` for the adjacency lists and arrays.
