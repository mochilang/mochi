# Solution for SPOJ AROAD - Another Road Problem

The task is to build the minimum cost network of roads such that every city is reachable from the capital `1` and the capital has at most `d` outgoing roads.

## Algorithm

1. **Minimum Spanning Tree**
   - Read all roads and build an MST using Kruskal's algorithm.
   - Keep track of which edges belong to the MST and the number of edges incident to the capital.
   - If the MST already uses at most `d` edges from the capital, output its cost.

2. **Degree Reduction**
   - While the capital's degree exceeds `d`, rebuild the tree's adjacency lists.
   - For every neighbor `v` of the capital, determine which vertices lie in the subtree rooted at `v`.
   - For each nonâ€‘MST edge `(a,b)` not touching the capital, if `a` and `b` belong to different capital subtrees, it can replace the edge from the capital to one of those subtrees.  The replacement cost is `w(a,b) - w(1,v)`.
   - Choose the replacement with the minimal additional cost and update the tree.
   - If no replacement exists for some required removal, the answer is `NONE`.

This process reduces the capital's degree one by one, always maintaining a spanning tree and minimal total cost.

## Complexity

Building the initial MST takes `O(m log m)` for sorting the `m` edges.  Each degree reduction scans all edges, giving at most `O((deg(1)-d) * m)` operations, which is acceptable for the given limits.
