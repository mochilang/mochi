# [Cutting out](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CUTOUT/)

## Problem Summary
Given an \(n \times n\) square with up to 100 axis-aligned rectangles removed,
compute the area of the largest axis-aligned rectangle that can still be cut
from the remaining paper. Input contains multiple test cases.

## Algorithm
1. Collect all x and y coordinates from rectangle borders together with 0 and \(n\).
2. Sort and deduplicate these coordinates. Any maximal empty rectangle will have
   its sides on these coordinates.
3. Build a grid of cells between consecutive coordinates and mark cells covered
   by the removed rectangles.
4. For each pair of horizontal lines `top` and `bottom`:
   - Height is `ys[bottom] - ys[top]`.
   - Scan columns using prefix sums to find the widest contiguous set of empty
     cells between these rows and compute candidate area.
5. The maximum area over all pairs is the answer.

The number of coordinates is at most \(2r + 2 \le 202\), so the algorithm runs
in \(O(k^3)\) time (about eight million operations) which easily fits within
the limits.
