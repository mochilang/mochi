# [Trigonometric optimization](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TRIOPT/)

## Problem Summary
Given three trigonometric functions $F_1,F_2,F_3$ (each is `sin` or `cos`) and an integer parameter $S$, find either the maximum or minimum value of
$F_1(x)+F_2(y)+F_3(z)$ subject to positive integers $x,y,z$ satisfying $x+y+z=S$.
The fourth input line specifies whether to `max`imize or `min`imize.

## Algorithm
1. **Small sums.** For $S \le 200$ every possible pair $(x,y)$ is enumerated
   and the third variable is $z=S-x-y$. The target expression is evaluated for
   each triple and the extremum is selected.
2. **Large sums.** For bigger $S$ the extremum is close to the solution of the
   continuous problem obtained via Lagrange multipliers.  This yields real
   estimates for $x,y,z$.  All integer candidates in a small neighbourhood
   (Â±12) around these estimates are tested together with boundary values.  The
   best value among these candidates is the result.

The implementation uses series expansions for `sin` and `cos` and prints the
value with ten digits after the decimal point.
