# [Shortcut](https://www.spoj.com/problems/SHORTCUT/)

## Problem Summary
Given a simple grid walk of `n` sections described by a string of `N`, `E`, `S`, `W`, find the shortest horizontal or vertical segment connecting two break points of the route. Output the length in 10â€‘meter units, the indices of the starting and ending break points, and the direction from start to end. Among equally short segments choose the one with the earliest start, and if tied, the one with the furthest end.

## Algorithm
1. Trace the walk, recording the coordinates of each break point and prefix counts of horizontal and vertical moves.
2. For every pair of break points `(i, j)` with `i < j`, check if they share the same `x` (vertical) or the same `y` (horizontal).
3. Use the prefix counts to ensure the path between them is not already a straight segment: for a vertical shortcut there must be a horizontal move between `i` and `j`, and vice versa.
4. For valid candidates compute the distance and keep the one with smallest length, breaking ties by earliest start then latest end.

This direct pairwise scan uses `O(n^2)` time and `O(n)` memory, which is sufficient for the provided tests.
