# [Roots of polynomial](https://www.spoj.com/problems/KMSL4B/)

## Problem Summary
For each test case, a polynomial of degree at most 20 is given by its coefficients `p0, p1, ..., pk`. Determine whether **all**
roots of the polynomial lie strictly inside the unit disc `|z| < 1`. Output `1` if every root is in the open unit disc and `0`
otherwise.

## Algorithm
We use the **Schur stability test**, which repeatedly transforms the polynomial and checks the relation between the first and
last coefficients. For a coefficient array `a = [p0, p1, ..., pk]`:

1. Reverse the coefficients so that `a[0]` is the leading term and `a[n]` the constant term.
2. While the degree `n` is greater than 0:
   - If `|a[0]| ≤ |a[n]|`, a root lies outside or on the unit circle → return `0`.
   - Compute a new polynomial `b` of degree `n-1` with
     `b[i] = (a[0]*a[i+1] - a[n]*a[n-1-i]) / (a[0] - a[n])` for `0 ≤ i < n`.
   - Set `a = b` and repeat with degree `n-1`.
3. After reducing to degree 0, the polynomial is stable iff `|a[0]| < 1`.

## Complexity
Each reduction step lowers the degree by one and performs `O(n)` arithmetic operations. For degree `k ≤ 20`, the total time is
`O(k^2)` and uses only `O(k)` extra space.
