## Problem Summary
Given a connected weighted graph with \(n\) cities and \(m\) roads, remove roads so that exactly \(n-1\) remain while keeping the graph connected and minimizing the maximum distance between any two cities (the tree diameter). Output this minimum farthest distance and the list of remaining roads.

## Algorithm
1. Build an adjacency list for the graph.
2. Run Dijkstra's algorithm from every city to compute its eccentricity (maximum distance to any city) and choose the city with minimum eccentricity as the tree center.
3. Run Dijkstra again from the center to build a shortest-path tree, recording parent pointers for each city.
4. Construct the tree edges from these parents and sort them by endpoints. Build a tree adjacency list.
5. Compute the tree diameter with two Dijkstra passes: from the center to a far node, then from that node to the farthest node.
6. Output the diameter and the sorted edge list.

The overall complexity is \(O(n^3)\), which is feasible for \(n \le 200\).
