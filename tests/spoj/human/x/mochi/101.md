## Problem Summary
We are given up to 50 states with travel times and toll costs between every pair. Starting at state 1 and wanting to reach state n within a total time limit `t` (< 1000), minimize the total toll paid. Multiple test cases are provided and terminate with `0 0`.

## Algorithm
1. Use dynamic programming on time. Let `dp[time][state]` be the minimum toll needed to arrive at `state` exactly at `time`.
2. Initialize all entries to a large value except `dp[0][0] = 0` for being at the starting state at time 0.
3. For each time from `0` to `t` and each state `u`, relax all edges `u -> v`:
   - If `time + travel[u][v]` is within the limit, update
     `dp[time + travel[u][v]][v] = min(dp[time + travel[u][v]][v], dp[time][u] + toll[u][v])`.
4. Scan all times for the destination state `n`. The smallest toll is the answer; if multiple times give this toll, pick the smallest time.

The DP runs in `O(t * n^2)` time and uses `O(t * n)` space.
