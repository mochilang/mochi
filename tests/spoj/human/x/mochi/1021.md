## Problem Summary
For each given string, output the minimum number of characters that need to be inserted to transform it into a palindrome.

## Algorithm
1. Let `rev` be the reverse of the string `s`.
2. Compute the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) between `s` and `rev` using a dynamic programming table with one-dimensional rolling array.
3. Iterate over characters of `s`; for each, update the DP row comparing with characters of `rev` from left to right while keeping previous cell value.
4. The LCS length represents the longest palindromic subsequence. The answer equals `len(s) - LCS`.

This runs in `O(n^2)` time per test case with `O(n)` memory.
