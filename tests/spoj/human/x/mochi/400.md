## Problem Summary
Given the number of columns and a message encrypted by writing the plaintext down the columns and then reading rows alternating left-to-right and right-to-left, recover the original message. Input ends with `0`.

## Algorithm
1. Let `n` be the number of columns and `s` the encrypted string.
2. Compute the number of rows `r = len(s) / n` and split `s` into `r` pieces of length `n`.
3. Reverse every odd-indexed piece to reconstruct the rows as they were written.
4. Read characters column by column, top to bottom and left to right, concatenating them to form the plaintext.

This reconstruction runs in `O(len(s))` time and uses `O(len(s))` memory.
