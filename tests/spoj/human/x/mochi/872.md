# [Mark-up](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MARKUP/)

## Problem Summary
Remove markup commands from a text stream. Commands begin with a backslash and include:
`\b` (bold toggle), `\i` (italics toggle), `\sN` (set font size to number `N` or restore if missing),
and `\*` (toggle markup processing). While processing is off, all sequences are treated literally
until another `\*` is seen. Unknown commands output the character following the backslash.

## Algorithm
1. Maintain a boolean `on` indicating whether markup processing is active (initially `true`).
2. Read the input character by character. For each character:
   - If `on` and the character is `\`:
     - `\b` or `\i`: consume command, toggling state but producing no output.
     - `\s`: consume the command and any following digits and optional decimal point.
     - `\*`: set `on = false`.
     - Otherwise: output the next character after the backslash.
   - If `!on` and the sequence `\*` appears: set `on = true` and consume it.
   - Otherwise output the character unchanged.
3. Continue until EOF, preserving newlines between lines.

This single pass over the input runs in linear time `O(n)`.
