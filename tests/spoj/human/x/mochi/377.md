# TAXI - Taxi

[Problem statement](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TAXI/)

## Algorithm
1. Read the number of test cases `k`.
2. For each test case:
   - Read integers `p`, `t`, `s`, and `c`.
   - Read the coordinates of the `p` people and the `t` taxis.
   - For each taxi-person pair compute the Manhattan distance. If
     `200 * distance <= s * c`, add an edge between the taxi and
     that person.
   - Run a depth-first-search based bipartite matching (Kuhn's
     algorithm) to find the maximum number of matchings between
     taxis and people.
   - Output the size of the matching.

## Correctness
If a taxi can reach a person within the time limit, an edge connects
that taxi to the person. Any valid assignment of taxis to people
corresponds to a matching in this graph where no vertex is used more
than once. The bipartite matching algorithm only produces matchings
and searches all possible augmenting paths, guaranteeing that the
resulting matching has maximum size. Therefore, the algorithm outputs
the maximum number of people that can be picked up.

## Complexity Analysis
Let `p` be the number of people and `t` the number of taxis. Building
the graph requires `O(p * t)` time. The DFS-based matching runs in
`O(p * t)` time as well. The memory usage is `O(p * t)` for the graph
representation and `O(p + t)` for auxiliary arrays.
