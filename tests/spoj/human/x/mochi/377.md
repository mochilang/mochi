## Problem Summary
We are given positions of up to 400 passengers and 200 taxis on a city grid where adjacent intersections are 200 meters apart. Each taxi moves at speed `s` (m/s) and must reach a passenger within `c` seconds. A taxi can take only one passenger. Determine the maximum number of passengers that can be picked up.

## Algorithm
1. For each taxi-passenger pair, compute the Manhattan distance in grid steps and convert to meters: `(abs(tx - px) + abs(ty - py)) * 200`.
2. Add an edge in a bipartite graph from the taxi to the passenger if this distance is at most `s * c`, meaning the taxi can reach the passenger in time.
3. Run a DFS-based augmenting path algorithm (maximum bipartite matching) to match taxis to passengers.
4. The size of the matching is the maximal number of passengers that can be served.

With at most 200 taxis and 400 passengers, the graph has at most 80,000 edges, so the simple DFS matching runs efficiently.
