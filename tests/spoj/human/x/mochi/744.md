# [Longest Permutation](https://www.spoj.com/problems/LPERMUT/)

## Problem Summary
Given an array `A` of `n` integers (1 ≤ Ai ≤ n), find the length of the longest contiguous subsequence that forms a permutation of `1..k` for some `k`.

## Algorithm
- Maintain a sliding window over the array with two pointers.
- Use a frequency array to ensure all elements in the window are distinct.
- Keep two deques storing indices of the minimum and maximum values in the current window.
- When adding a new element, update the deques and shrink the window if a duplicate appears.
- After each extension, if `min == 1` and `max == window length`, update the best length.

This runs in O(n) time with O(n) additional memory.
