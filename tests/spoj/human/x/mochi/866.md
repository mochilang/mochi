# [DNA Translation](https://www.spoj.com/problems/DNA/)

## Problem Summary
Given a DNA strand containing only the bases A, C, G and T, determine the protein sequence it encodes. The strand may be the primary or complementary strand and may appear in forward or reverse order. A valid protein begins with the start codon `AUG` in the transcribed mRNA and ends at the first stop codon (`UAA`, `UAG`, or `UGA`).

## Algorithm
1. **Generate candidate mRNA strands** from the input by considering all four possibilities: complement, reverse-complement, original strand, and reversed strand. Replace every `T` with `U` to form mRNA.
2. **For each mRNA**, scan left to right for a start codon `AUG`. From there, read codons in steps of three until a stop codon is reached. Map codons to their amino-acid abbreviations using the standard genetic code.
3. **Output** the sequence of amino acids joined with hyphens for the first candidate that yields a valid translation. If none produce a valid protein, print `*** No translatable DNA found ***`.

The approach runs in linear time with respect to the length of the DNA strand.
