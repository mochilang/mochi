## Problem Summary
Given Willi's number for a honey comb in a hexagonal spiral, output its
coordinates `(x, y)` in Maja's axial grid system. Numbers are less than 100000
and appear one per line until EOF.

## Algorithm
1. Cells form hexagonal rings around the origin. The maximum number in ring `r`
   is `1 + 3*r*(r+1)`.
2. Determine the ring containing `n` by increasing `r` until the above maximum
   is at least `n`.
3. The first cell of ring `r` is at `(0, r)`. Compute the zero-based offset from
   this start: `offset = n - (3*(r-1)*r + 2)`.
4. Walk around the six sides of the hexagon using directions
   `(-1,0),(0,-1),(1,-1),(1,0),(0,1),(-1,1)`, moving `min(offset, r)` steps per side
   until the offset is consumed.
5. Output the resulting `(x, y)`.

This runs in `O(r)` time per query where `r = O(sqrt(n))`.
