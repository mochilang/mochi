## Problem Summary
Numbers are written on a grid starting at (0,0) and following diagonals. Given coordinates (x, y) within 0..10000, output the number at that point or "No Number" if none exists.

## Algorithm
1. For each point (x, y):
   - If `x == y` or `x == y + 2`, the position holds a number.
   - Otherwise, output `No Number`.
2. For valid positions:
   - If `x` is even, the value is `x + y`.
   - If `x` is odd, the value is `x + y - 1`.
3. Print the computed value for each test case.

The time complexity is O(1) per test case and O(1) extra space.
