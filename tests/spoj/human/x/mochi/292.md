## Problem Summary
Given up to 10\,000 treasures placed along a line at positions `d_i` with vanishing times `t_i`, Alibaba may start at any point and move at unit speed. Collecting a treasure takes no time. Determine the smallest time to collect all treasures before their deadlines, or report `No solution` if it is impossible.

## Algorithm
1. Treasures are already given in increasing order of position. Starting from any treasure index `s`, Alibaba only needs to change direction once: either go left first then sweep to the rightmost treasure, or go right first then sweep to the leftmost.
2. For each starting index and both directions, simulate the journey:
   - Move in the chosen direction, accumulating travel time and verifying the deadline of each visited treasure.
   - After reaching one end, reverse direction and continue collecting the remaining treasures, again checking deadlines.
3. Record the total time when all treasures are collected. Among all feasible routes keep the minimum; if none are feasible output `No solution`.

This brute-force over starting positions performs at most `O(n^2)` steps and is sufficient for the constraints.
