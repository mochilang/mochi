# [Truth or not](https://www.spoj.com/problems/LIAR/)

## Problem Summary
Given an `N×N` matrix where `A[i][j]` is `'T'` if student `i` claims student `j` always tells the truth and `'L'` otherwise, classify students as truth-speakers or liars.  A truth-speaker's entire row must match the final classification, whereas a liar needs only one incorrect statement.  For each test case, report the minimum and maximum number of liars possible.  If no assignment satisfies all constraints, the class is paradoxical.

## Algorithm
For each candidate student `k` (and an extra case where everyone is assumed to be a liar), derive a tentative classification:
- If `k` is truthful, the classification is exactly the contents of row `k`.
- If no one is truthful, classify all students as liars.

Given a classification, verify its consistency:
1. For every student marked as truthful, their row must exactly match the classification.
2. For every student marked as liar, at least one entry in their row must contradict the classification.

Each valid classification yields a number of liars; keep track of the minimum and maximum values across all candidates.  If no classification is valid, declare the class paradoxical.  This checks at most `N+1` scenarios and each scenario takes `O(N^2)` time, which is feasible for `N ≤ 70`.
