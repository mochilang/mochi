## Problem Summary
On a truncated icosahedron (soccer ball) consisting of 12 pentagons and 20
hexagons, a simple polygon is drawn along the edges. The polygon divides the
ball into two regions and one of them is painted green. For each vertex of the
polygon we are given how many incident faces are painted (1 or 2). The side
between the last and first vertex always lies between two hexagons. For each
test case, compute how many pentagons remain black, how many hexagons remain
white, and how many total faces are painted green.

## Algorithm
Let `n` be the number of vertices of the polygon and `c2` the count of input
values equal to `2`.

1. Each added face increases the boundary length by three edges, so the number
   of green faces is `g = (n - 3) / 3`.
2. From vertex count analysis, the number of green pentagons is
   `p = 2*c2 + 6 - n`.
3. The number of green hexagons is `h = g - p`.
4. Black (unpainted pentagons) = `12 - p`.
5. White (unpainted hexagons) = `20 - h`.
6. Output `black white g`.

The computation is `O(n)` per test case, needing only counts of the vertex
labels.
