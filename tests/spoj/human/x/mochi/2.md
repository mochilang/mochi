## Problem Summary
Given up to 10 ranges `[m, n]` with `1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 10^9` and `n - m ≤ 100000`, output all primes in each range. Print one prime per line and separate test cases with an empty line.

## Algorithm
1. Precompute all primes up to `√10^9 ≈ 31623` using the classic Sieve of Eratosthenes.
2. For each query range `[m, n]`:
   - Create a boolean array of size `n - m + 1` initialized to `true`.
   - For each precomputed prime `p` such that `p^2 ≤ n`, mark multiples of `p` inside the range as composite. The first multiple to mark is `max(p^2, ceil(m/p) * p)`.
   - After marking, any index still `true` corresponds to a prime number `m + i`. Ignore the number `1`.
3. Output all primes found in order. Print an empty line between consecutive test cases.

The precomputation takes `O(31623 log log 31623)` and each query runs in `O((n-m+1) log log n)` time with `O(n-m+1)` extra space.
