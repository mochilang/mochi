# [Longest Common Substring](https://www.spoj.com/problems/LCS/)

## Problem Summary
Given two strings of up to 250000 lowercase letters, find the length of their longest common substring. If none exists, output 0.

## Algorithm
1. Map each character 'a'..'z' to an integer and precompute powers of a base for two large prime moduli.
2. Compute prefix hashes of both strings for each modulus.
3. Binary search on the substring length `L`.
4. For a given `L`, hash all substrings of the first string and store the pairs of hashes in a set.
5. Slide over the second string, compute each substring's hash pair, and check for a match in the set.
6. The maximum `L` passing the check is the answer.

This uses double rolling hashes and runs in `O((n+m) log min(n,m))` time.
