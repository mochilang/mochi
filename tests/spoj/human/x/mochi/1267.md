## Problem Summary
Given parameters \(m,n,a,b,c\) and an \(m \times n\) configuration of Conway's Game of Life, determine the minimum number of generations back to a Garden of Eden configuration. A Garden of Eden has no possible predecessor under the rules.

## Algorithm
1. Encode each grid as a bit mask with at most 20 bits.
2. Precompute neighbour masks for every cell.
3. Enumerate all \(2^{m n}\) states. For each state compute its successor using the rules and build a reverse adjacency list from successor to all predecessors.
4. Run breadth-first search starting from the given configuration following reverse edges. The distance to the first state with no predecessors is the answer.
5. If BFS explores all reachable states without encountering a state with no predecessors, output `-1`.

The search space is bounded by \(2^{20}\) so this exhaustive enumeration is feasible.
