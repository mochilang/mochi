# [Needle in a Haystack](https://www.spoj.com/problems/NHAY)

## Problem Summary
Read a pattern length, the pattern string, and a haystack string for each test case. Output all starting indices (0-based) where the pattern occurs in the haystack. Separate answers for different test cases with a blank line.

## Algorithm
1. Build the longest proper prefix which is also suffix (LPS) array for the pattern.
2. Scan the haystack with the KMP algorithm, comparing characters and using the LPS array to skip unnecessary comparisons.
3. Whenever the pattern index reaches its length, record the start position and reset the index using the LPS value.
4. After processing the haystack, print recorded positions and an empty line.

This runs in `O(n + m)` time per test case with `O(m)` extra memory.
