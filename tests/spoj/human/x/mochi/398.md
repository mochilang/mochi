## Problem Summary
Given several dice with fixed face values, determine labels for an additional die with a specified number of faces such that selected sums occur exactly a given number of times when all dice are rolled together. If multiple dice satisfy the requirements, output the lexicographically smallest sorted list of face values; otherwise report that it is impossible.

## Algorithm
1. **Base Sum Counts** – Use dynamic programming to compute how many ways each sum can be obtained from the fixed dice. Since at most 20 dice with values up to 50 are provided, sums up to 1000 are sufficient.
2. **Backtracking Search** – Assign face values to the unknown die one by one in non‑decreasing order. For each candidate value, subtract its contribution to the required sums using the precomputed base counts. If any required count becomes negative, prune the branch.
3. **Validation** – After assigning all faces, check whether the remaining required counts are all zero. Because values are tried in ascending order, the first valid assignment found is the lexicographically smallest.
4. **Output** – Print the face values in non‑decreasing order or "Impossible" if no assignment exists.

This approach is efficient due to the small number of faces (at most 6) and tight pruning based on remaining sum counts.
