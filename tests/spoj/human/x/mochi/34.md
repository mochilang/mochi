## Problem Summary
Given the dimensions of a rectangular room and the coordinates of several lava holes,
find the point inside the room that maximizes the distance to the nearest hole.
For each test case output the coordinates of this safest point rounded to one
decimal place.

## Algorithm
1. Store the hole coordinates in two lists for quick access.
2. Define `minDistSq` to compute the squared distance from a point to its nearest
   hole.
3. Use a hill-climbing search: starting from a set of grid points (10Ã—10 over the
   room), repeatedly explore the eight neighboring directions.
4. Begin with a step size equal to the larger room dimension. Move to a neighbor
   if it increases the minimal distance; otherwise halve the step size.
5. Continue until the step size drops below 0.5. Among all explored starts keep
   the point with the largest distance.
6. Round each coordinate to one decimal using `floor(x*10+0.5)/10` and print in the
   required format.

This strategy approximates the center of the largest empty circle and is
sufficient for one-digit precision.
