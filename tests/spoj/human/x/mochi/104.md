# HIGH - Highways

[Problem statement](https://www.spoj.com/problems/HIGH/)

## Algorithm

For each test case, we are given `n` cities (`n \le 12`) and a list of possible two-way connections.
We must count the number of different highway networks such that between every pair of cities there is exactly one path.
This equals the number of spanning trees of the graph.

We apply the Matrix-Tree theorem:

1. Build the `n \times n` Laplacian matrix `L` of the graph.
   - `L[i][i]` is the degree of city `i`.
   - `L[i][j]` is `-1` if cities `i` and `j` are connected, otherwise `0`.
2. Remove the last row and column from `L` to form an `(n-1) \times (n-1)` matrix `M`.
3. Use Gaussian elimination to compute `det(M)`.
4. The determinant is the number of spanning trees. When `n = 1`, output `1`.

## Correctness

The Matrix-Tree theorem states that any cofactor of the Laplacian matrix equals the number of spanning trees of the graph.
By constructing `L`, forming `M`, and computing its determinant, the program counts all possible highway networks.
For the special case `n = 1`, the graph has exactly one spanning tree, so the algorithm outputs `1`.

## Complexity Analysis

Building the Laplacian takes `O(n^2)` time and space.
Gaussian elimination on an `(n-1) \times (n-1)` matrix runs in `O(n^3)` time.
With `n \le 12`, this is easily within limits.
