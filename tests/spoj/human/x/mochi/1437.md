# [Longest path in a tree](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PT07Z/)

## Problem Summary
Given an unweighted, undirected tree, determine the number of edges in the longest path between any two nodes.

## Algorithm
1. Build an adjacency list for the tree from the input edges.
2. Perform a BFS from an arbitrary node (0) to find the farthest node `u`.
3. Perform a second BFS from `u`; the maximum distance found is the tree's diameter.
4. Output this maximum distance.

This two-BFS method runs in linear time, O(N), over the number of nodes.
