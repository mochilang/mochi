## Problem Summary
We have `N` beauty spots connected by one-way streets. Every spot must belong to exactly one tour, where each tour is a directed cycle visiting its nodes once (returning to the start). The cost of a tour is the sum of its street lengths. Choose tours covering all spots so that the total cost is minimal.

## Algorithm
1. Build an `N×N` cost matrix `cost` where `cost[i][j]` is the minimum length of a street from `i` to `j` (or a very large number if none). Set `cost[i][i]` to a large number to forbid single-node cycles.
2. Finding the optimal set of tours is equivalent to finding a minimum-cost cycle cover of the directed graph.
3. Use the Hungarian algorithm on `cost` to compute a minimum-cost assignment where each node has exactly one outgoing and one incoming street.
4. Sum the costs of the selected edges; this is the minimal total length of all tours.

The Hungarian algorithm runs in `O(N^3)` time, which is fine for `N ≤ 200`.
