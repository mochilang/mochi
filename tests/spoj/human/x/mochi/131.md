# SPOJ SQDANCE - Square dance

Problem: https://www.spoj.com/problems/SQDANCE/

We process pairs of prime indices and count how many times adding a new pair would create a square product. Each pair {p,q} can be seen as an edge between two nodes. A perfect square arises when the product of a set of edges contains each prime an even number of times, which corresponds to a cycle in this graph.

## Algorithm
1. For each test case, initialize a disjoint set union (Union-Find) structure for P primes.
2. For every incoming relation {p,q}:
   - If p and q belong to the same set, the edge would form a cycle; increase the answer but do not store the edge.
   - Otherwise, merge the two sets.
3. Output the number of rejected edges for each test case.

The DSU operations run in near-constant time, giving overall complexity `O((P+R) Î±(P))` per test case.
