# [Triangle From Centroid](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TRICENTR/)

## Problem Summary
Given side length `a` of a triangle and the distances from the centroid to the three sides (`g_a`, `g_b`, `g_c`), compute the triangle's area and the distance from the orthocenter to the centroid.

## Algorithm
1. Convert centroid distances to heights: `h_a = 3*g_a`, `h_b = 3*g_b`, `h_c = 3*g_c` since the centroid lies one-third along each height.
2. Compute the area using side `a` and height `h_a`: `A = 0.5 * a * h_a`.
3. Derive the remaining sides from the area and corresponding heights:
   - `b = 2*A / h_b`
   - `c = 2*A / h_c`
4. Compute the circumradius `R = a*b*c / (4*A)`.
5. The squared distance from centroid `G` to orthocenter `H` on Euler's line is `GH^2 = 4*(R^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)/9)`.
6. Output `A` and `GH` formatted to three decimal places.

This method runs in constant time and uses only a few arithmetic operations per test case.
