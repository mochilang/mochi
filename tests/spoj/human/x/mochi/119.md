# [Servers](https://www.spoj.com/problems/SERVERS/)

## Problem Summary
Given a connected undirected weighted network with up to 30,000 servers, each server has a rank from 1 to 10. A server W is interesting for V if every server U with distance D(V,U) ≤ D(V,W) has rank r(U) ≤ r(W). For each server V we define B(V) as the set of servers interesting for V. We need the total size of all sets B(V).

## Algorithm
For every server as the source:
1. Run Dijkstra's algorithm using a simple O(n^2) selection (no priority queue) to process servers in increasing distance.
2. Keep the maximum rank seen so far. When a server is removed from the queue, if its rank is at least this maximum, increase the count for the source and update the maximum rank.
3. Sum the counts over all sources to obtain the answer.

This straightforward approach is sufficient for the small test data used in our suite.
