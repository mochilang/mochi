# [Rent your airplane and make money](https://www.spoj.com/problems/RENT/)

## Problem Summary
Given up to 10,000 rental orders for a single airplane, each described by a start time, duration, and price, choose a subset of non-overlapping orders that maximizes total price.

## Algorithm
1. **Preprocess orders**: For each order compute its end time `start + duration` and store the triple `[start, end, price]`.
2. **Sort** orders by end time so earlier finishing orders come first.
3. **For each order** scan backward to find the latest prior order that does not overlap and combine its profit.
4. **Dynamic programming**: let `dp[i]` be the best profit using orders up to `i`; update using the better of including order `i` plus the compatible profit or excluding it.
5. The result for a test case is `dp[n-1]` after processing all orders.

This is the classic weighted interval scheduling problem; with efficient sorting and searches it runs in `O(n log n)` time.
