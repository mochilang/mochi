## Problem Summary
A truck starts \(L\) distance units away from town with \(P\) units of fuel and leaks one unit per distance unit. There are \(N\) fuel stops along the road, each with some fuel and a known distance from town. The tank has unlimited capacity. Find the minimum number of refueling stops needed to reach town, or determine that it is impossible.

## Algorithm
1. Convert each stop's distance from town to distance from the starting point and append the town as a final stop with zero fuel.
2. Sort the stops by increasing distance from the start.
3. Traverse the stops while tracking available fuel and distance since the previous stop. Maintain a max-heap of fuel amounts from stops already passed.
4. If the remaining fuel is insufficient to reach the next stop, repeatedly refuel from the largest available stop in the heap, counting each refuel.
5. If the heap is empty and the next stop is unreachable, return -1. Otherwise continue until town is reached.

This greedy approach runs in \(O(N \log N)\) time due to sorting and heap operations.
