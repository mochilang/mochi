# SPOJ 348 - Expedition

We are given a truck starting `L` units away from the town with `P` units of fuel.
There are `N` fuel stops between the truck and the town.  Stop `i` is
`d_i` units from the town and provides `f_i` units of fuel.  The truck
consumes one unit of fuel per unit distance and the tank has unlimited
capacity.

The task is to reach the town using the minimum number of refuelling
stops.  If it is impossible, output `-1`.

## Algorithm

1. Convert each stop's distance to its distance from the starting
   position: `d = L - d_i`.  Append the town as a final stop at
   distance `L` with `0` fuel.
2. Sort all stops by increasing distance from the start.
3. Traverse the sorted stops, maintaining a maxâ€‘heap of fuel amounts
   from stops that have been passed.
4. Before moving to the next stop, subtract the distance travelled from
   the current fuel.  If fuel becomes negative, repeatedly refuel using
   the largest available amount from the heap, counting the number of
   refuels.  If the heap is empty, reaching the town is impossible.
5. Push the current stop's fuel into the heap and continue.
6. After processing all stops, the refuel count is the answer.

The sorting and heap operations give `O(N log N)` time complexity.
