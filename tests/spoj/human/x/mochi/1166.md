# [Dead Fraction](https://www.spoj.com/problems/DEADFR/)

## Problem Summary
Given a decimal of the form `0.dddd...` where the digits contain at least one full
cycle of the repeating part, reconstruct the original fraction with the smallest
denominator that produces the given digits.

## Algorithm
1. Let `s` be the digits between `0.` and `...`.
2. For each possible length `k` (1 to `len(s)`) of the repeating suffix:
   - Split `s` into prefix `a` and suffix `b` of length `k`.
   - Interpret `s` and `a` as integers `n` and `aVal`.
   - The value of the decimal with repeating `b` is `(n - aVal) / (10^{len(a)} * (10^k - 1))`.
   - Reduce this fraction using `gcd` and keep the one with the smallest denominator.
3. Output the numerator and denominator separated by `/`.

The number of digits is at most 18, so at most 18 candidate fractions are
examined. The arithmetic involves integers up to roughly `10^{36}`.
