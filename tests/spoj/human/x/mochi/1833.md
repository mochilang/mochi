## Problem Summary
Given last week's solved Sudoku grid and this week's partially filled puzzle, determine whether the new puzzle can be produced from the solved grid using these allowed transformations:
- rotating the grid,
- swapping rows within a band or swapping entire bands,
- swapping columns within a stack or swapping entire stacks,
- permuting the digits 1 through 9.
Output `Yes` if such a transformation exists, otherwise `No`.

## Algorithm
1. Parse the 9×9 solved grid and the 9×9 partial puzzle and record the positions of all filled cells.
2. For each of the four rotations of the solved grid, perform a depth‑first search that assigns rows and columns to the puzzle:
   - Rows and columns are mapped while respecting 3×3 band/stack boundaries and ensuring each index is used once.
   - As cells are matched, maintain a bijective digit mapping between the solved grid and the puzzle.
   - If any choice leads to conflict in row/column assignments or digit mapping, backtrack.
3. If all filled cells can be matched under some rotation, the puzzle is derivable; otherwise report `No`.

The DFS prunes incompatible assignments early, so the check completes quickly on the 9×9 grid.
