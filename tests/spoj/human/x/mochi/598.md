# [Increasing Subsequences](https://www.spoj.com/problems/INCR/)

## Problem Summary
For a permutation of the numbers 1..N, define its *degree of increase* as the length of its longest increasing subsequence (LIS).
Given N and B, count how many permutations have degree of increase exactly B. 1 ≤ N ≤ 40 and 1 ≤ B ≤ 5. Report the answer modulo 1,000,000,000.

## Algorithm
1. Precompute binomial coefficients C(n, k) for n ≤ 40.
2. Let `F[n][k]` be the number of permutations of n elements whose LIS length is at most k. Recurrence:
   - `F[0][k] = 1` for all k, and `F[n][0] = 0` for n > 0.
   - For n > 0 and k > 0:
     `F[n][k] = Σ_{i=1}^{n} C(n-1, i-1) * F[i-1][k-1] * F[n-i][k]`.
     We fix the position `i` of element `1`. Elements left of `1` must have LIS ≤ k−1 (since `1` can extend any increasing subsequence there), while the right part must have LIS ≤ k.
3. The number of permutations whose LIS length is exactly B equals `F[N][B] - F[N][B-1]` (modulo 1,000,000,000).
4. Precompute `F` for all `n ≤ 40` and `k ≤ 5` and answer each test case in O(1).

This dynamic programming runs in O(N²·B) ≈ 8,000 operations, easily meeting the limits.
