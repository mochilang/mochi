## Problem Summary
Contestants line up and receive consecutive numbers starting from 2. The first keeps number 2 and every second contestant behind him is removed. The next remaining contestant keeps his number `k` and every `k`-th contestant behind him is removed. This process repeats with the queue continually shrinking. For each query `n`, output the `n`-th number that survives this elimination process.

## Algorithm
1. Precompute lucky numbers with a sieve-like simulation:
   - Start with the list `[2, 3, ..., limit]` where `limit` is large enough for at least 3000 survivors (e.g. 50000).
   - For each index `i` with value `step`:
     - Remove every `step`-th element occurring after position `i` in the current list.
     - Stop when `step` exceeds the remaining length.
2. Read integers until `0` and output the `n`-th precomputed number for each.

The sieve produces all required lucky numbers within the problem constraints.
