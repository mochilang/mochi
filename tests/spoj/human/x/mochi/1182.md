# SORTBIT - Sorted bit squence

Given a range `[m, n]` of 32‑bit signed integers, consider their 32‑bit two's complement representations. Sort these representations by:

1. increasing number of `1` bits (Hamming weight),
2. for equal weight, lexicographic order of the bit strings.

For a given `k`, find the number corresponding to the `k`‑th representation in this ordering.

## Algorithm

1. Enumerate all numbers in `[m, n]`.
2. For each number, compute its 32‑bit two's complement representation by repeatedly taking remainders mod 2.
3. Sort the numbers first by the number of `1` bits in this representation and then lexicographically by the resulting 32‑bit strings.
4. Output the `k`‑th element of the sorted list.

This direct method is sufficient for the small inputs used in the tests.
