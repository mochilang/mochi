## Problem Summary
Given a binary word equation with variables `a`-`z` and fixed lengths for each variable, count how many assignments of binary strings of appropriate lengths make both sides of the equation identical.

## Algorithm
1. **Expand both sides** of the equation into arrays representing every bit position after substitution. For each variable occurrence, expand it into its length number of positions.
2. **Union-Find constraints:**
   - Create a union-find structure for each variable bit position.
   - Traverse both expanded arrays simultaneously. For each position pair:
     - If both are constants, they must match.
     - If one is a constant and the other is a variable bit, fix that variable bit to the constant value.
     - If both are variable bits, union their positions.
   - Conflicting constraints yield zero solutions.
3. **Count solutions:** After processing all positions, each union-find component without a fixed value can be either 0 or 1. The total number of solutions is `2^(#free components)`. Variables that never occur contribute an additional `2^(length)` each.

This algorithm runs in linear time in the total expanded length (â‰¤ 10,000) and uses union-find for efficient constraint propagation.
