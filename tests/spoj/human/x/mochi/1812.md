# [Longest Common Substring II](https://www.spoj.com/problems/LCS2/)

## Problem Summary
Given up to 10 lowercase strings (each length \<= 100000), determine the length of the longest substring that appears in all of them. If no common substring exists, output 0.

## Algorithm
1. Preprocess each string into two rolling-hash prefix arrays using different moduli.
2. Binary search on the substring length `L` from 0 to the minimum string length.
3. For each candidate `L`:
   - Generate hash values for all length-`L` substrings of the first string and store them in a set.
   - For every other string, compute its length-`L` substring hashes and intersect with the current set.
   - If the set becomes empty, no common substring of length `L` exists.
4. Track the largest `L` for which the set remains non-empty and output it.

The rolling hashes let each intersection step run in linear time, giving an overall time complexity of `O(n log m)` where `n` is the total input size and `m` is the minimum string length.
