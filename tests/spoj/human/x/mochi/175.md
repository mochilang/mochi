## Problem Summary
Given a triangulated convex polygon with \(n\) vertices, determine the largest number of triangles in the triangulation that can be intersected by a single elementary triangle whose vertices are among the polygon's vertices.

## Algorithm
In any triangulation of a convex \(n\)-gon, there always exists an elementary triangle that intersects every triangle of the triangulation. This can be achieved by choosing three well-spaced vertices so that the triangle spans the polygon.

Since a triangulated \(n\)-gon contains exactly \(n-2\) triangles, the answer for each test case is simply \(n-2\).

Steps per test case:
1. Read \(n\).
2. Ignore the following \(n-2\) lines describing the triangulation.
3. Output \(n-2\).

## Complexity
Reading the input takes \(O(n)\) time per test case, while the computation itself is \(O(1)\).
