# SPOJ OFORTUNE - Ohgas' Fortune

We are given an initial fund and several investment operations, each defined by
an interest type (simple or compound), an annual interest rate and an annual
operation charge.  For every dataset we must choose the operation that yields
the largest final amount after a fixed number of years.

For each operation we simulate the fund year by year using integer arithmetic.
The interest rate is a multiple of `1/8192`, so we parse the rate into an
integer numerator `r = rate * 8192`.  Each year the interest is computed as

```
interest = (balance * r) / 8192    // fractional part is discarded
```

If the operation is compound, the interest is added to the balance before the
annual charge is subtracted.  For simple interest the interest is accumulated
separately and only the charge is subtracted from the balance.  After processing
all years, the final amount is the balance for compound interest or the balance
plus the accumulated interests for simple interest.  We evaluate all operations
and output the maximum final amount.

The constraints are small (≤10 years and ≤100 operations), so this direct
simulation is sufficient.
