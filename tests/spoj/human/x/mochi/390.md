## Algorithm
1. For each test case read integers `a`, `b`, `s`, `m`, `n`.
2. Compute horizontal distance `h = m * a` and vertical distance `v = n * b`.
3. The launch angle in degrees is `atan2(v, h) * 180 / pi`.
4. The total distance travelled is `sqrt(h*h + v*v)` and velocity is `distance / s`.
5. Format angle and velocity to two decimal places.
6. Repeat until a line of five zeros.

## Complexity
For each test case the calculations are constant time, so the complexity is `O(1)` per case.
