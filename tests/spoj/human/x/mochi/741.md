# Steady Cow Assignment (SPOJ STEAD)

We are given `N` cows (≤1000) and `B` barns (≤20).  Each cow lists all barns
from most to least preferred, and each barn has a capacity.  A cow's happiness
for an assignment is the rank of the chosen barn in her list.  We must assign
cows to barns without exceeding capacities so that the range of used ranks
(`max_rank - min_rank + 1`) is minimised.

## Algorithm

We binary search the width `W` of the rank interval.  For a fixed `W` we slide a
window `[L, L+W-1]` over the ranks and test whether all cows can be assigned to
barns whose ranks fall inside this window.  For every window we build a flow
network:

- source → each cow with capacity `1`
- cow → barn if the barn's rank for that cow is within `[L, L+W-1]`
- barn → sink with capacity equal to the barn capacity

We run Dinic's max‑flow algorithm.  If the maximum flow equals `N`, all cows can
be placed within that window.  If any window works, width `W` is feasible.
Binary searching `W` from `1` to `B` yields the minimal feasible width.

## Complexity

`B` ≤ 20, so we examine at most `B` windows for each binary search step.  The
flow network has at most `N + B` nodes and `N·B` edges; Dinic runs in `O(E√V)`
which is fast here.  Overall complexity is `O(B · maxflow · log B)`.
