# [Aggressive cows](https://www.spoj.com/problems/AGGRCOW/)

## Problem Summary
For each test case, you are given positions of N barn stalls and a number C of cows. Place the cows in distinct stalls so that the minimum distance between any two cows is as large as possible. Output this largest minimum distance.

## Algorithm
1. **Sort Stalls:** Arrange the stall positions in nondecreasing order using merge sort.
2. **Binary Search Distance:**
   - Let `low = 0` and `high = max(stall) - min(stall) + 1`.
   - While `low + 1 < high`:
     - Set `mid = (low + high) / 2`.
     - Greedily place cows, always putting the next cow in the earliest stall at least `mid` away from the previous one.
     - If at least `C` cows can be placed, set `low = mid`; otherwise set `high = mid`.
3. Print `low` after the search, which is the maximum feasible minimum distance.

This approach sorts once in \(O(N \log N)\) and performs \(O(\log R)\) feasibility checks, each \(O(N)\), where \(R\) is the range of stall coordinates.
