# [EXCHNG - Exchanges](https://www.spoj.com/problems/EXCHNG/)

Given a sequence of compare-exchange instructions `CE(a,b)`, build an
undirected graph of registers where an edge connects `a` and `b` whenever
such an instruction appears. Duplicates are ignored since repeated
instructions between the same registers do not increase reliability.

A program is reliable only if every register participates in at least two
exchanges. Each register with degree `< 2` requires one additional
instruction.

## Algorithm

1. Parse the instructions and maintain for each register the count of
   distinct neighbours it is compared with.
2. After processing all instructions, count how many registers have degree
   less than `2`.
3. Output this count.

## Complexity

Let `n` be the number of registers and `m` the number of instructions. The
algorithm runs in `O(n + m)` time and uses `O(n + m)` memory.
