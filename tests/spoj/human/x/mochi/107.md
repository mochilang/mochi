# [Calendar of the Maya](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MAYACAL/)

## Problem Summary
Given a date expressed in the Maya Calendar Round (a Tzolkin day number and name together with a Haab day number and month), produce all equivalent Long Count dates that fall within baktuns 8 and 9. If the given Calendar Round date is illegal, output 0.

## Algorithm
1. Store the 20 Tzolkin day names and 19 Haab months (with month lengths, 5 days for Wayeb, 20 otherwise).
2. Validate the input values against these lists.
3. Compute offsets within the Tzolkin (260‑day) and Haab (365‑day) cycles for the target date relative to 8.0.0.0.0, known to be 9 Ajaw 3 Sip.
4. Use Chinese Remainder Theorem on these offsets to obtain the first matching day in the 18 980‑day Calendar Round cycle.
5. Generate all Long Count dates by repeatedly adding 18 980 days while the result stays within baktuns 8 and 9, converting each absolute day count back to `(baktun.katun.tun.winal.kin)`.
6. Output the number of matches followed by each Long Count date in ascending order.
