# [Ambiguous Permutations](https://www.spoj.com/problems/AMBIGUOUS/)

## Problem Summary
Given a permutation of the integers `1..n`, an inverse permutation lists for each `i` the position of `i` in the original order. A permutation is *ambiguous* when it is identical to its inverse. For each test case, determine if the given permutation is ambiguous.

## Algorithm
1. Read `n` and the permutation `p[1..n]`. Stop when `n` is `0`.
2. Build the inverse permutation `inv` so that `inv[p[i]] = i` for every `i`.
3. Compare `p` and `inv`; if all entries match, output `"ambiguous"`, otherwise output `"not ambiguous"`.

This runs in `O(n)` time and `O(n)` extra space per test case.
