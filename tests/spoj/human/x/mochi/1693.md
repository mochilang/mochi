We are given each guard's belief about swallows carrying coconuts and a friendship graph. A vote assignment incurs a cost of 1
for each guard that votes against his belief and 1 for each pair of friends that disagree.

This can be modelled as a minimum $s$-$t$ cut. Create a node for every guard and add two special nodes: `source` meaning vote
`0` and `sink` meaning vote `1`.

* If guard $i$ believes `1`, add an edge `source → i` with capacity `1` (penalty for voting `0`).
* If guard $i$ believes `0`, add an edge `i → sink` with capacity `1` (penalty for voting `1`).
* For every friendship $(i,j)$ add an undirected edge of capacity `1` between $i$ and $j` which contributes to the cut when
guards vote differently.

The capacity of a cut equals the total disagreement cost. Running a max-flow algorithm (Dinic) gives the minimum cut value,
which is the minimum possible sum of disagreements plus belief violations.
