# Lineland Airport

We are given a piecewise linear landscape defined by `N` points
`(x_i, y_i)` in strictly increasing `x`.  Between consecutive points the
height changes linearly.  We must choose a horizontal segment of length
`L` where the terrain is lowered (never raised) to a constant level.
The cost is the area of removed material.  For an interval `[s, s+L]`
with minimum height `m`, this cost is

```
A(s+L) - A(s) - L * m
```

where `A(x)` is the integral of the landscape height from the beginning
up to `x`.

The optimum start position `s` only changes when either endpoint touches
a vertex or when the heights at the two endpoints become equal.  Thus we
collect candidate start positions consisting of

* every vertex `x_i`,
* every `x_i - L` (so that the right endpoint hits a vertex), and
* every solution of `y(s) = y(s+L)` for any pair of segments.

For each candidate we compute
* the minimal height inside `[s, s+L]` by checking the endpoints and all
  vertices in that range, and
* the area using pre‑computed prefix integrals and segment slopes.

The smallest value over all candidates is the required minimal amount of
rock to remove.  Complexity is `O(N^2)` candidates and linear scanning of
points inside each interval (`N ≤ 500`).
