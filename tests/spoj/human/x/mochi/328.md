# [BISHOPS - Bishops](https://www.spoj.com/problems/BISHOPS/)

On an \(N \times N\) chessboard a bishop moves any number of squares along a
   diagonal. Two bishops attack each other if they share a diagonal.
   The task is to place as many bishops as possible so that none attack each
   other.  The board size can be as large as \(10^{100}\), so big integers are
   required.

## Algorithm

1. The two main diagonals of an \(N \times N\) board contain \(2N-2\) squares
   that are pairwise non‑attacking when \(N > 1\). For \(N = 1\) there is only
   one square, so the answer is 1.
2. Read each \(N\) from the input (until EOF) using arbitrary precision
   integers.
3. If \(N = 1\) output 1, otherwise output \(2(N-1)\).

The computation per test case is \(O(\text{length}(N))\) due to big‑integer
arithmetic.
