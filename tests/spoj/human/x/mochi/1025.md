## Problem Summary
Two separate fashion shows rate the hotness of men and women. Each show has **N** participants (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000) with ratings from 0 to 10. To form couples, a dating service pairs each man with one woman. A couple's "hotness bond" is the product of their ratings. We must maximize the total hotness bond across all N couples for each test case.

## Algorithm
1. Read N and the two lists of ratings.
2. Sort the men's ratings and the women's ratings independently in nondecreasing order.
3. Pair the i‑th man with the i‑th woman in these sorted lists. This pairing maximizes the sum of products because matching the largest ratings together gives the greatest contribution.
4. Sum all `men[i] * women[i]` and output the result.

Sorting dominates the complexity. Using an efficient sort gives `O(N log N)` time; with N ≤ 1000 this is easily fast. The memory usage is `O(N)`.
