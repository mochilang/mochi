# [Grandpa's Rubik Cube](https://www.spoj.com/problems/GRC/)

## Problem Summary
Given an initial 3×3 Rubik's cube configuration and a list of rotations, determine whether applying the rotations yields a solved cube where each face has a single color and all six faces are different.

## Algorithm
1. Parse the 9-line net into six 3×3 faces in the order: up, left, front, right, back, down.
2. For each rotation ±k:
   - Map k to the corresponding face (1=left, 2=front, 3=right, 4=back, 5=up, 6=down).
   - Rotate that face clockwise for +k or counter-clockwise for -k, moving the adjacent edge strips appropriately.
3. After all rotations, check that every face is uniform (all nine stickers identical).
4. Print "Yes, grandpa!" if solved, otherwise print "No, you are wrong!".

Each move updates a constant number of stickers, so processing m moves runs in **O(m)** time with **O(1)** extra space beyond the 54-cell cube array.
