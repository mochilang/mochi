# [Grandpa's Rubik Cube](https://www.spoj.com/problems/GRC/)

## Problem Summary
Given an initial 3×3 Rubik's cube configuration and a list of rotations, determine whether applying the rotations yields a solved cube where each face has a single color and all six faces have distinct colors.

## Algorithm
1. Parse the 9-line net into six 3×3 faces in the order: up, left, front, right, back, down.
2. For each rotation ±k:
   - Map k to the corresponding face (1=left, 2=front, 3=right, 4=back, 5=up, 6=down).
   - Rotate that face clockwise for +k or counterclockwise for -k, adjusting neighboring strips accordingly.
3. After processing all rotations, check that every face is uniform and that the six face colors are distinct.
4. Output "Yes, grandpa!" if solved, otherwise "No, you are wrong!".
