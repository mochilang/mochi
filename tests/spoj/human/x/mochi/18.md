## Problem Summary
You receive a three-digit integer that was encrypted by subtracting 1 from the original number.
The task is to restore the original value.

## Algorithm
1. Read the encrypted integer `e`.
2. Add one to obtain the decrypted value `d = e + 1`.
3. Output `d`.

This is an `O(1)` time and `O(1)` space computation since it performs a single addition.
