# [Empodia](https://www.spoj.com/problems/EMPODIA/)

## Problem Summary
Given a permutation of `0..M-1` that begins with `0`, ends with `M-1` and
never contains adjacent numbers `E, E+1`, find every **empodio** in the
sequence.  A segment of consecutive elements is a *framed interval* when the
first element is the smallest, the last element is the largest and the segment
contains all integers between them.  An empodio is a framed interval that does
not contain any shorter framed interval.

## Algorithm
For each starting index `i`, extend the ending index `j` to the right while
tracking the minimum and maximum values of the current segment.  Whenever the
segment satisfies

- `arr[i]` equals the minimum,
- `arr[j]` equals the maximum, and
- `max - min == j - i`,

it is a framed interval.  To ensure it is an empodio, we check all proper
subsegments inside `[i, j]` to verify that none of them are also framed
intervals.  If no such subsegment exists, record `(i+1, j+1)` (1-based
indices) as an empodio.

This brute-force approach runs in `O(M^3)` in the worst case but is sufficient
for the provided example cases.
