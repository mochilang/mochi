# Divisors

We need all integers $N$ with $1 \le N \le 10^6$ where the number of divisors $d(N)$ is the product of two distinct primes $p \cdot q$.

## Algorithm

1. Build an array of smallest prime factors for all numbers up to $10^6$ using a sieve.
2. For each $N$, factor it via the smallest prime factors to compute $d(N)$.
3. Check whether $d(N)$ equals $p\cdot q$ with two distinct primes by dividing $d(N)$ by its smallest factor and verifying the other factor is prime.
4. Count all such $N$ and print only every 9th one.

The largest $d(N)$ for $N\le 10^6$ is only 240, so the primality test for the remaining factor is inexpensive.
