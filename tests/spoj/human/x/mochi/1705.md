# [The Game of Efil](https://www.spoj.com/problems/GAMEFIL/)

## Problem Summary
Given a final configuration of Conway's Game of Life on an \(m \times n\) toroidal grid (wrap-around edges) with at most 16 cells in total, determine how many different previous configurations could have produced it. Output "Garden of Eden." when there are no such predecessors.

## Algorithm
1. Represent a grid configuration as a bitmask of length \(m \times n\).
2. Enumerate all \(2^{m\times n}\) possible predecessor masks.
3. For each mask, apply the Game of Life rules on a torus:
   - For every cell count neighbors using modulo arithmetic, allowing the same cell to be counted multiple times due to wrap-around.
   - Apply survival/birth rules to obtain the next state.
4. If the resulting state equals the given configuration, increment the counter.
5. Report the counter; if zero, print "Garden of Eden.".

The brute-force search is feasible because the grid contains at most 16 cells, so at most 65,536 configurations are examined.
