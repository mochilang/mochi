# [The Next Palindrome](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PALIN/)

## Problem Summary
Given a positive integer `K` (up to 1,000,000 digits), output the smallest palindrome strictly larger than `K` for each test case.

## Algorithm
1. Convert the number string into a list of digits.
2. If all digits are `9`, the answer is `1` followed by `(n-1)` zeros and another `1`.
3. Otherwise mirror the left half onto the right half.
4. If the mirrored number is not larger than the original, increment the middle digit(s) with carry propagation to the left, mirroring each change to the right.
5. Convert the resulting digit list back to a string.

This runs in `O(n)` time per test case and uses `O(n)` additional space for the digit array.
