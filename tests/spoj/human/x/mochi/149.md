# [Fencing in the Sheep](https://www.spoj.com/problems/FSHEEP/)

## Problem Summary
Given a polygonal fence that is star-shaped with respect to the origin, and a list of sheep positions, count how many sheep lie inside or on the fence. The polygon's vertices are listed in counter-clockwise order and the shepherd stands at the origin from which the whole fence is visible.

## Algorithm
For each test case:
1. Read the polygon vertices and store them in order.
2. For each sheep point, use the ray-casting method to determine containment:
   - Iterate over every edge of the polygon.
   - If the point lies exactly on an edge, count it as inside.
   - Otherwise, toggle an inside flag whenever the edge crosses a horizontal ray to the right of the point, using cross products to avoid floating-point issues.
3. Count the points for which the inside flag is set and print the total.

This approach runs in \(O(nm)\) time per test case, which is acceptable for the sample data and demonstrates the point-in-polygon logic including boundary handling.
