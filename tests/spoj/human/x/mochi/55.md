## Problem Summary
Jasiek describes a filled figure on grid paper. Starting from a boundary square marked by `P`, a sequence of moves `N`, `S`, `E`, `W` walks around the centres of all boundary squares in anti-clockwise order and ends with `K`. The figure has no holes and consists of connected unit squares. For each description, count how many squares are coloured.

## Algorithm
1. Read moves between `P` and `K` and store them in order.
2. Treat the centres of boundary squares as lattice points. Begin at `(0,0)` and update coordinates for each move.
3. During the walk accumulate the cross-product `x_prev*y - x*y_prev` for the shoelace formula to obtain twice the polygon area.
4. Let `A = |area|/2` and `B` be the number of moves (boundary length). The number of coloured squares equals `A + B/2 + 1`.
5. Output this value for every test case.

The algorithm is linear in the number of moves (â‰¤20,000) and uses constant extra space.
