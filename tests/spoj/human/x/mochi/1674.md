## Problem Summary
Given testimonies of detained people, each naming exactly one person as guilty, find the minimal number of people that could contain all perpetrators without contradicting any testimony. Innocent people always name a guilty person, while perpetrators may name anyone.

## Algorithm
1. Represent testimonies as a directed graph where each person points to the named person. The graph is a set of cycles with trees attached.
2. Use a queue to process nodes with zero in-degree (leaves). If a leaf is not already dominated, mark its successor as guilty and enqueue the successor when its in-degree drops to zero.
3. After removing leaves, remaining nodes form disjoint cycles. For each cycle, perform dynamic programming to solve a vertex cover problem on the cycle, considering any already marked nodes. Evaluate two cases (first node selected or not) and take the minimal result.
4. The total number of marked nodes gives the size of the smallest group of potential perpetrators.

This algorithm runs in O(N) per test case.
