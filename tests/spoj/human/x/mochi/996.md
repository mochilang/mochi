## Problem Summary
Given `p` and `q` with `p > q > 0`, convert `p/q` into its simple continued fraction and print it using periods for blanks and dashes for fraction bars.

## Algorithm
1. Use Euclid's algorithm to collect the continued fraction coefficients of `p/q`.
2. Ensure the last coefficient is `1`; if not, decrement the last value and append `1`.
3. Build the ASCII representation from the innermost fraction outward:
   - Start with a single line `"1"`.
   - For each coefficient from the tail toward the head:
     - Form a line `a.+.` plus a bar of `-` repeated for the current width.
     - Prepend a centered `1` line padded with `.`.
     - Left-pad all existing lines with `.` so widths match.
4. Output `Case i:`, the original fraction `p / q`, then the constructed lines.

This produces the required right-aligned continued fraction picture in `O(k)` time for `k` terms.
