# BENEFACT - The Benefactor

[SPOJ problem](https://www.spoj.com/problems/BENEFACT/)

## Algorithm

1. Read the tree of `n` places as an adjacency list with edge lengths.
2. Run a breadthâ€‘first search (BFS) from an arbitrary node (1) to find the farthest vertex `u`.
3. Run BFS again from `u` to obtain the maximum distance `d` to any node.
4. Output `d` which equals the length of the longest street.

## Correctness

- In a tree, every pair of nodes is connected by exactly one path. BFS therefore computes the exact distance from the start node to all others.
- One endpoint of the tree diameter is the farthest vertex from any starting node. The second BFS from that endpoint yields the length of the diameter, i.e. the longest street.

## Complexity

Let `n` be the number of places. Building the adjacency list takes `O(n)` time and memory.
Each BFS visits every vertex once, so the total time complexity per test case is `O(n)`
and the memory usage is `O(n)`.
