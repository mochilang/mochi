# SPOJ 413 - Word Puzzles

This problem asks us to locate a set of words inside a rectangular grid of
uppercase letters. For each word we must report the coordinates of its first
letter (with the top‑left corner being `(0,0)`) and a letter describing the
orientation.  The eight possible directions are enumerated clockwise starting
from north and labeled `A` through `H`.

## Algorithm

For every test case:

1. Read the grid dimensions `L` and `C` and the number of words `W`.
2. Store the `L` grid rows as strings.
3. For each of the `W` words:
   - Scan all grid cells looking for the first character of the word.
   - From every matching cell try all eight directions defined by the
     vectors `(dr, dc)`:
     `(-1,0), (-1,1), (0,1), (1,1), (1,0), (1,-1), (0,-1), (-1,-1)`.
   - Walk along the chosen direction checking that every character of the
     word matches and that we remain inside the grid boundaries.
   - When a full match is found, output the starting coordinates and the
     corresponding orientation letter (`A` + direction index).
4. Print an empty line between test cases.

Each word appears exactly once, so the first match is the answer.  The grid
size is at most `1000×1000` and there are up to `1000` words, but the search is
fast enough for the intended input sizes because we stop immediately after
finding each word.
