## Problem Summary
Given the total number of apples that two girls have together and how many more apples the first girl has, determine the number of apples each girl owns. There are ten such test cases.

## Algorithm
1. For each of the ten test cases read `sum` and `diff` as big integers.
2. The girl with more apples has `(sum + diff) / 2` apples.
3. The other girl has `(sum - diff) / 2` apples.
4. Output these two values on separate lines for every case.

Using big integer arithmetic ensures correct handling of numbers up to $10^{100}$.
