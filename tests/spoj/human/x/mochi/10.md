# [Complicated Expressions](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CMEXPR/)

## Problem Summary
Given an arithmetic expression consisting of lowercase variables, operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and parentheses, remove all redundant parentheses while preserving the meaning of the expression. Multiple expressions are processed.

## Algorithm
1. **Parse** each expression using recursive descent respecting operator precedence (`*` and `/` > `+` and `-`) and left associativity to build an abstract syntax tree.
2. **Rebuild** the expression with minimal parentheses:
   - A child expression needs parentheses if its precedence is lower than its parent's.
   - When precedences are equal, parentheses are needed only for the right child of `-` if it is `+` or `-`, and for the right child of `/` if it is `*` or `/`.
   - In all other cases parentheses can be safely removed due to associativity.
3. Output the formatted expression.

This approach runs in linear time with respect to the expression length.
