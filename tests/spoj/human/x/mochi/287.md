# [NETADMIN - Smart Network Administrator](https://www.spoj.com/problems/NETADMIN/)

We are given an undirected graph with up to 500 vertices.  House `1` is the
admin and `k` other houses want to be connected to it.  Each cable must run
along a path from the admin to a house.  Cables of the same color cannot share
an edge.  We need the minimum number of colors.

If every edge can carry at most `C` cables, then each color corresponds to one
unit of capacity on every edge.  The task becomes: what is the minimum `C`
such that we can send one unit of flow from the admin to each of the `k` houses
with edge capacity `C`?  The answer is the minimal `C`.

To check a candidate `C` we build a flow network:

* For every street `(u, v)` add two directed edges `u→v` and `v→u`, each with
  capacity `C`.
* Add a super sink node.  Connect each required house `h` to the sink with an
  edge of capacity `1`.
* Compute the maximum flow from source `1` to the sink.
* If the flow is at least `k`, `C` colors suffice.

We binary search `C` from `1` to `k`.  The feasibility test uses Dinic's
algorithm (`O(E√V)` per run on these constraints) which is fast for the small
graph size.

## Complexity

Let `n` be the number of vertices, `m` the number of edges and `k` the number
of houses to connect.  Each max‑flow run is `O(m√n)` and binary search adds a
`log k` factor, so the overall complexity is roughly
`O(m √n log k)`.
