# [Pouring Water](https://www.spoj.com/problems/POUR1/)

## Problem Summary
Given two empty jugs with capacities `a` and `b` litres, determine the minimum number of operations needed to obtain exactly `c` litres in either jug. The allowed operations are filling a jug, emptying a jug, or pouring water from one jug to the other until one becomes empty or full.

## Algorithm
1. For each test case, read `a`, `b` and `c`.
2. If `c` is greater than both `a` and `b`, or `c` is not divisible by `gcd(a, b)`, output `-1` because the volume is unattainable.
3. Otherwise simulate the process twice:
   - Start with jug `a` full and pour to `b` until the target `c` is reached.
   - Start with jug `b` full and pour to `a`.
   Each simulation repeatedly pours the minimum possible amount, refilling an empty jug or emptying a full one while counting steps.
4. The answer is the smaller number of steps from the two simulations.

This approach runs in `O((a + b) / gcd(a, b))` per test case because each pour reduces the total discrepancy by at least `gcd(a, b)`.
