## Problem Summary
Given a set of `L` letters with known frequencies and `K` keypad keys, assign consecutive letters to keys (in order) so that the typing cost is minimized. The cost of a letter is its frequency multiplied by its position on the key (1 for first letter on a key, etc.). If multiple layouts have the same minimal cost, prefer the one with more letters on the last key, then on the previous key, and so on.

## Algorithm
1. **Precompute Costs:** Build prefix sums of frequencies and weighted positions to compute cost of placing letters `i..j` on one key in `O(1)`.
2. **Dynamic Programming:** Let `cost[i][k]` be the minimal cost to assign first `i` letters to `k` keys. Transition by trying all possible previous splits `t < i` and adding the cost of grouping `t+1..i` on the last key.
3. **Tie-breaking:** Along with each DP state, store the list of group sizes. When costs are equal, compare these lists from the end to prefer layouts with more letters on later keys.
4. **Reconstruct Layout:** The DP result `cost[L][K]` contains group sizes for the optimal layout. Iterate through keys and assign letters sequentially according to these sizes.

The DP runs in `O(L^2 K)` time with `O(LK)` space (`L ≤ 90`, `K ≤ 90`), which is easily manageable.
