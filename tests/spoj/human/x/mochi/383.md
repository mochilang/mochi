# [European railroad tracks](https://www.spoj.com/problems/EUROPEAN/)

## Problem Summary
Given up to eight required railway gauges (distances between two rails), construct rail positions starting at 0 so that for every gauge there exists a pair of rails with exactly that separation. We seek the minimum number of rails; at most five are guaranteed to suffice.

## Algorithm
1. Read the set of gauges, remove duplicates and sort them.
2. Try limits from 2 to 5 rails. For each limit, perform a depth‑first search:
   - Begin with positions `[0]`.
   - Compute which gauges are satisfied by current positions by checking all pairwise differences.
   - If all gauges are satisfied, return the positions.
   - If the number of rails equals the limit, backtrack.
   - Choose the largest unsatisfied gauge `g` and for every existing rail `p` attempt to add a new rail at `p + g` (if not already present), keeping the list sorted.
3. The first successful search yields the minimal rail count and positions, which are printed.

Because the search space is tiny (≤5 rails and ≤8 gauges), this backtracking strategy quickly finds an optimal solution.
