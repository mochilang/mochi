# [Another Sequence Problem](https://www.spoj.com/problems/SEQ2/)

## Problem Summary
Given an initial integer sequence, process a series of commands:
- `MAKE-SAME i t c`: set `t` numbers starting at position `i` to value `c`.
- `INSERT i t s`: insert `t` numbers `s` after position `i` (at the start if `i=0`).
- `DELETE i t`: remove `t` numbers starting at position `i`.
- `REVERSE i t`: reverse `t` numbers starting at position `i`.
- `GET-SUM i t`: output the sum of `t` numbers starting at position `i`.
- `MAX-SUM`: output the maximum subarray sum of the current sequence.

## Algorithm
1. Store the sequence in a dynamic list that supports slicing.
2. For each command:
   - `MAKE-SAME`: overwrite the specified range with value `c`.
   - `INSERT`: split the sequence at position `i` and concatenate the new values in between.
   - `DELETE`: rebuild the sequence excluding the removed range.
   - `REVERSE`: swap elements from both ends of the range until they meet.
   - `GET-SUM`: iterate over the range to accumulate the sum and print it.
   - `MAX-SUM`: apply Kadane's algorithm to compute the maximum subarray sum.
3. Indices in the input are 1-based; internally they are converted to 0-based positions.

This straightforward list-based approach runs in linear time for each operation, which is
sufficient for small input sizes and mirrors the intended behavior of the problem.
