## Problem Summary
For each test case a family tree is given. Each description line lists a person and all of their children. Given an integer `d`, determine which people have the largest number of descendants exactly `d` generations away. Output the top three names, extended to include ties, along with their descendant counts.

## Algorithm
1. Build an adjacency map from every person to their list of children while collecting all names in the tree.
2. For each person, perform a breadth‑first search over the tree limited to depth `d` and count nodes encountered exactly at depth `d`.
3. Gather pairs of `(name, count)` for people with a non‑zero count and sort them by descending count and then ascending name.
4. Output the first three pairs, and continue outputting further pairs while their counts equal the third place count.

The search for each person visits at most all nodes in the tree, so with up to 1000 people the approach runs in `O(n^2)` time and uses `O(n)` additional space.
