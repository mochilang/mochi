# [Mixtures](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MIXTURES/)

## Problem Summary
Harry must mix `n` mixtures with colors `0..99`. Mixing two adjacent mixtures
produces a new color `(a+b) mod 100` and generates `a*b` units of smoke.
Choose an order of mixing that minimizes the total smoke.

## Algorithm
1. Precompute prefix sums modulo `100` so the resulting color of any
   subarray `[i,j]` is `(prefix[j+1] - prefix[i]) mod 100`.
2. Use dynamic programming on intervals:
   - `dp[i][j]` is the minimum smoke to mix mixtures `i..j` into one.
   - For lengths from `2` to `n`, try all split points `k` between `i` and `j`:
     `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + color(i,k) * color(k+1,j))`.
3. The answer for a test case is `dp[0][n-1]`.

The DP considers `O(n^2)` states with `O(n)` transitions each, leading to
`O(n^3)` time, which is feasible for `n <= 100`.
