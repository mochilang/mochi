## Problem Summary
Given a number `n` encoded as `"xy ez"` where `n = (10*x + y) * 10^z`, repeatedly remove every second person from a circle of `n` people until one remains. Input ends with `00e0`. For each test case output the position of the survivor assuming counting starts from person `1` and the first removed is `2`.

## Algorithm
1. Parse `n` from the encoded format.
2. Find the highest power of two `p` such that `p <= n` by doubling from `1`.
3. The survivor's position is `2 * (n - p) + 1`, a well-known formula for the Josephus problem with step `2`.

This runs in `O(log n)` time per test case with constant space.
