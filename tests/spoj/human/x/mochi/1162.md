# [Tic-Tac-Toe ( II )](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TOE2)

## Problem Summary
Given a 3x3 tic-tac-toe board configuration represented as a 9-character string, determine if it could be the final state of a valid game. `X` always moves first, players alternate turns, and the game stops immediately when a player wins. Boards contain characters `X`, `O`, or `.` for empty cells.

## Algorithm
1. Count the number of `X` and `O` on the board. A valid final state must have either `x == o` or `x == o + 1`.
2. Check all eight winning lines for both players.
3. If both players win, the board is invalid.
4. If `X` wins, ensure `x == o + 1` and `O` does not win.
5. If `O` wins, ensure `x == o`.
6. If neither wins, the board must be full (`x == 5` and `o == 4`).
7. Output `valid` if the above conditions hold; otherwise output `invalid`.

The algorithm runs in constant time since the board size is fixed.
