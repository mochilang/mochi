## Problem Summary
Given an amount `x` and `k` coin values `v1...vk` (with unlimited supply), determine if `x` can be paid such that the number of coins used respects `c1 >= c2 >= ... >= ck` where `ci` is the count of value `vi` coins.

## Algorithm
1. Convert the constraint on counts into new coin values.  Define prefix sums `w_i = v1 + v2 + ... + vi` for `i=1..k`.  Any valid payment corresponds to non‑negative integers `d_i` such that `x = Σ d_i * w_i`.
2. The problem reduces to standard unbounded coin change on `w_i` values.
3. Use dynamic programming with a boolean array `dp[0..x]` where `dp[j]` is true if amount `j` is attainable.
4. Initialize `dp[0]=true`.  For each `w` and for `j` from `w` to `x`, set `dp[j] |= dp[j-w]`.
5. After processing all `w_i`, `dp[x]` indicates if the payment is possible. Output `YES` if reachable, otherwise `NO`.

The complexity is `O(k * x)` with `k ≤ 5` and `x ≤ 100000`, which is efficient.
