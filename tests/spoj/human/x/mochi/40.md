## Problem Summary
Given a simple polygon defined by \(N\) vertices in order, compute the coordinates of its center of gravity. Each vertex is given by integer coordinates, and the polygon may be non-convex. Output the centroid with exactly two digits after the decimal point.

## Algorithm
1. Read \(N\) and the sequence of vertices.
2. Apply the shoelace formula. For each edge from \((x_i, y_i)\) to \((x_j, y_j)\):
   - Compute \(\text{cross} = x_i y_j - x_j y_i\).
   - Accumulate \(\text{areaSum} += \text{cross}\).
   - Accumulate centroid sums: \(C_x += (x_i + x_j) \cdot \text{cross}\) and \(C_y += (y_i + y_j) \cdot \text{cross}\).
3. Close the polygon by processing the edge from the last vertex to the first.
4. The centroid is given by \(C_x = C_x / (3\, \text{areaSum})\) and \(C_y = C_y / (3\, \text{areaSum})\).
5. Round each coordinate to two decimal places (0.005 rounds up to 0.01) and print.

This runs in \(O(N)\) time with constant additional memory, suitable for up to one million vertices.
