# [Decorate the wall](https://www.spoj.com/problems/DECORATE/)

## Problem Summary
Given a wall of width `W` and height `H` with `n` existing axis-aligned paintings, determine where to place a new painting of size `w' x h'` without overlapping any existing painting. If multiple placements are possible, choose the one with the lowest `y` coordinate, breaking ties with the lowest `x`. If no placement exists, output `Fail!`.

## Algorithm
1. Collect candidate `x` positions: `0` and the right edges (`x2`) of all existing paintings. Likewise collect candidate `y` positions: `0` and the top edges (`y2`).
2. Sort both candidate lists.
3. For each `y` in ascending order and each `x` in ascending order:
   - Ensure the new painting fits inside the wall: `x + w' <= W` and `y + h' <= H`.
   - Check for overlap with each existing rectangle using axis-aligned intersection tests.
   - The first valid position found is the answer.
4. If no position is valid, print `Fail!`.

The candidate sets contain at most `n + 1` elements (`n ≤ 200`), so at most about `40k` positions are examined, each compared against up to `200` rectangles—easily within limits.
