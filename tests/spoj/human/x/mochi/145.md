## Problem Summary
Given up to 100000 points on the plane, find the smallest circle that contains all of them. For each test case output the minimal radius and the circle center, both rounded to two decimal places.

## Algorithm
1. Read all points and shuffle their order using a simple pseudo-random generator.
2. Maintain the minimal enclosing circle while scanning the points:
   - Start with the circle of radius 0 centered at the first point.
   - For each new point `p` outside the current circle, set the circle to `p` with radius 0 and reconsider previous points `q`:
     - If `q` lies outside, update the circle to the one having `p` and `q` on its boundary.
     - For each earlier point `r` outside this circle, replace it with the circumcircle through `p`, `q` and `r`.
3. After processing all points, output the circle's radius and center.

This is a randomized incremental algorithm equivalent to Welzl's algorithm and runs in expected linear time.
