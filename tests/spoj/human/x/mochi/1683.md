## Problem Summary
Given a postfix expression consisting of lowercase operands and uppercase binary operators, rewrite it so that evaluating the new expression with a queue (FIFO) produces the same result as the original evaluated with a stack (LIFO).

## Algorithm
1. **Build an expression tree** from the postfix notation using a stack of nodes.
2. **Level-order traversal:** gather all nodes by depth with a breadth-first search (left to right).
3. **Output** the nodes starting from the deepest level up to the root and within each level from right to left.  Concatenating these values yields the required expression.

This ordering ensures operands appear in the queue in the needed order while operators are applied from lower levels to higher levels, matching the stack evaluation of the original expression.
