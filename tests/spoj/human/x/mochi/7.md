## Problem Summary
You are given the full list of polygonal faces of a 3D object built from unit cubes. 
For each test case, read the faces and output the volume (number of unit cubes) of the solid.
Each face lies in a plane parallel to the coordinate axes and is described by its corner points.

## Algorithm
1. Parse all faces and collect every distinct `x`, `y`, and `z` coordinate. Add extra
   padding coordinates `0` and `1001` to surround the object.
2. Sort and deduplicate the coordinate lists to obtain compressed grids along the
   three axes.
3. For every face whose `x` coordinate is constant, mark the corresponding plane in
   the compressed grid.  For a grid cell `(y,z)` we check whether the cell center
   lies inside the face polygon using the ray‑casting point‑in‑polygon test.
4. For each `(y,z)` column sweep through the `x` segments from left to right.  Each
   time a marked plane is crossed the state toggles between outside and inside;
   segments where the state is inside represent solid voxels.
5. Sum the volume of every solid voxel as the product of its segment lengths in the
   `x`, `y`, and `z` directions.

This approach runs in `O(N)` on the number of compressed voxels and avoids explicit
3‑D flooding.  Coordinate compression keeps the grid small enough for the given
limits.
