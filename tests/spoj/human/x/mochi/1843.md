## Problem Summary
Given a permutation of the 26 capital letters, determine whether it could
be the result of applying some permutation twice to the alphabet.

## Algorithm
1. Convert the permutation string to a mapping from each letter position to its
   target position.
2. Decompose the mapping into cycles.
3. Count how many cycles have each even length.
4. The permutation has a square root iff every even cycle length appears an
   even number of times.  Cycles of odd length are always acceptable.
5. Output `Yes` when the condition holds, otherwise `No`.

This analysis runs in constant time for the fixed alphabet size.
