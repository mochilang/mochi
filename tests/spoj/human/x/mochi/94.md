# [Numeral System of the Maya](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MAYA/)

## Problem Summary
Numbers are given in the Mayan numeral system. Each number starts with the
count of its digits `n` followed by `n` lines describing digits from top to
bottom. A digit consists of groups separated by spaces. Each group is either a
series of dots `.` representing values `1`–`4` or a dash `-` representing `5`.
The special shell symbol `S` stands for zero. Positions are weighted 1, 20,
360, 7200, … (the third position uses 360 instead of 400). Convert each Mayan
number to its decimal value.

## Algorithm
1. Repeatedly read `n`. Stop on `n = 0`.
2. For each of the next `n` digit lines:
   - If the line is `S`, the digit value is 0.
   - Otherwise split the line by spaces; each dash contributes 5 and dots
     contribute their count.
3. Multiply each digit by its positional weight, using weights `1, 20, 360,
   7200, 144000, …` from bottom to top, and sum the results.
4. Output the decimal value.

The parsing and conversion are linear in the number of digits.
