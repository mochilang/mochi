## Problem Summary
Given `N` weights where the `i`-th weight has mass `3^(i-1)`, and a target mass `X` placed on the first pan of a balance, determine which weights to place on each pan so that the balance is in equilibrium. Output the indices of weights placed on the first and second pans respectively, or `-1` if it's impossible.

## Algorithm
1. The maximum mass we can balance is the sum of all weights: `(3^N - 1) / 2`. If `X` exceeds this sum, there is no solution.
2. Otherwise convert `X` to **balanced ternary** using `N` digits. For each digit:
   - Compute `rem = X % 3` and update `X = X / 3`.
   - If `rem == 2`, change it to `-1` and increase `X` by one (carry).
3. After processing `N` digits, if `X` is not zero, balancing is impossible.
4. Digits `-1` correspond to weights added to the **first** pan (with the target mass), digits `1` to the **second** pan, and digits `0` are unused.
5. Print indices with digit `-1` on one line and indices with digit `1` on the next line.

This method runs in `O(N)` time and uses `O(N)` space.
