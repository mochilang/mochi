# [Simple Numbers with Fractions Conversion](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TCNUMFL/)

## Problem Summary
Convert a number given in base `r` (with a comma separating integer and fractional parts) to base `s` with exactly `l` digits after the comma. Digits are `0-9` and `A-Z` for values up to 35. No rounding is performed; extra fractional digits are generated by repeatedly multiplying the remainder.

## Algorithm
1. Split the input token `n` into integer and fractional strings.
2. Convert the integer string from base `r` to a big integer using repeated multiplication and addition.
3. Convert this integer value to base `s` by repeated division and taking remainders.
4. For the fractional part, treat the digits as a numerator over `r^k`. Repeatedly multiply the numerator by `s`, taking the integer quotient as the next digit and updating the remainder.
5. Output the converted integer part, a comma, and the `l` generated fractional digits.

The procedure runs in `O(d + l)` time for `d` input digits and uses `O(1)` additional space beyond the big integers.
