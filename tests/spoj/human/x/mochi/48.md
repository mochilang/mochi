## Problem Summary
Given a circular string describing bead sizes, find the 1-based index where breaking the necklace produces the lexicographically smallest rotation of the string.

## Algorithm
Use **Booth's algorithm** to compute the lexicographically minimal rotation in linear time:

1. Concatenate the string with itself to allow easy comparison of rotations.
2. Maintain two candidate starting indices `i` and `j` and an offset `k` for current comparison.
3. Compare characters at `i+k` and `j+k`:
   - If they match, increment `k`.
   - If a character at `i+k` is greater, shift `i` by `k+1`.
   - If a character at `j+k` is greater, shift `j` by `k+1`.
   - Reset `k` after each shift and ensure `i` and `j` are distinct.
4. The smaller of `i` and `j` is the beginning of the minimal rotation. Return this position plus one for 1-based indexing.

This algorithm runs in O(n) time where n is the length of the necklace.
