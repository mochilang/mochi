## Problem Summary
Given train schedules between `n` cities for a single day, generate all optimal connections from city `1` to city `n`. A connection is optimal if no other connection departs no earlier, arrives no later, and has a shorter travel time. Each schedule entry specifies departure time, arrival time, and destination city.

## Algorithm
1. **Parse Input:**
   - Convert times `hh:mm` to minutes from midnight.
   - Build adjacency lists of edges `(departure, arrival, destination)` for each city.
2. **Earliest Arrival Search:**
   - For every train leaving city `1`, perform a breadth‑first search over states `(time, city)`.
   - From a state, traverse only trains with departure times not earlier than the current time.
   - Track the best (earliest) arrival time for each city; after the search, record the arrival time at city `n`.
3. **Collect Candidate Connections:**
   - Pair each departure from city `1` with its computed arrival time, ignoring unreachable cases.
4. **Filter Dominated Connections:**
   - Remove duplicates.
   - Discard any connection `(A,B)` if another connection `(A',B')` exists with `A' ≥ A`, `B' ≤ B` and `(B'−A') < (B−A)`.
5. **Format Output:**
   - Sort remaining pairs by departure time (already in input order) and print the count followed by each `hh:mm hh:mm` pair.

The search explores at most all schedule entries for each departure from city `1`; filtering is quadratic in the number of candidates. This is sufficient for the sample data and demonstrates the logic for computing optimal connections.
