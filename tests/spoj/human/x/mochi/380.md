## Problem Summary
Given a lecture transcript where the uppercase word `BULLSHIT` marks the end of a game, compute the average number of distinct words spoken before each shout. Words consist only of English letters and comparisons are case-insensitive. Ignore the word `BULLSHIT` itself and ignore any unfinished game at the end.

## Algorithm
1. **Tokenization:** Read the text line by line, splitting into words by any non-letter character. Convert letters to uppercase while building each word.
2. **Game processing:** Maintain a set of distinct words for the current game. When encountering `BULLSHIT`, add the set size to a running total, increment the game count, and reset the set.
3. **Final computation:** After processing all lines, compute the greatest common divisor of the total word count and the number of games and output the reduced fraction `total / games`.

This approach runs in linear time relative to the number of characters in the input.
