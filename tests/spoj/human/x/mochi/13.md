## Problem Summary
Given a set of dialogues made of English statements and questions, build an adaptive answerer. Statements describe whether a subject performs an activity (predicate plus optional object). Questions ask about activities: whether a subject does something, who performs an activity, or what actions a subject performs. The system must remember previous statements, detect contradictions, and answer questions accordingly.

## Algorithm
1. Parse each sentence as a statement or question. Statements update a knowledge base mapping `(subject, predicate, object)` to either positive or negative truth. The verb form is normalized to handle subjects like `I` and `you`.
2. When a question is read, consult the knowledge base:
   - For `does subject predicate [object]?`, check positive/negative facts or generic subjects (`everybody`, `nobody`) to answer `yes`, `no`, or `maybe`.
   - For `who predicates [object]?`, gather all subjects with matching positive facts, respecting enumeration rules, or answer with `nobody`/`I don't know`.
   - For `what does subject do?`, list all stored activities for the subject (including generics), maintaining order and avoiding duplicates.
3. Replace pronouns in answers (`I` â†” `you`), ensure verb agreement, and detect contradictions: if conflicting statements appear, all subsequent answers become `I am abroad.`
4. Print each question, the generated answer, and blank lines as required by the dialogue format.

This approach processes each sentence once, resulting in linear time complexity with respect to the number of sentences in a dialogue.
