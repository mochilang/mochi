# [City Game](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CTGAME/)

## Problem Summary
Given several city areas described by grids of `F` (free) and `R` (reserved) cells, determine the largest rectangular block of free cells in each area. Each unit in the rectangle yields $3, so output the maximum possible profit for each area.

## Algorithm
1. For each row, maintain an array of heights where `heights[c]` counts consecutive `F` cells above the current cell in column `c`.
2. After updating the row's heights, compute the largest rectangle in this histogram using a stack:
   - Scan across the heights with a zero-height sentinel at the end.
   - Push indices while heights are non-decreasing.
   - When a lower height appears, repeatedly pop indices, using the popped height and current index to compute area widths, tracking the maximum.
3. The best rectangle area times 3 gives the profit for the area.

This approach runs in O(M*N) time using O(N) extra space, handling grids up to 1000Ã—1000.
