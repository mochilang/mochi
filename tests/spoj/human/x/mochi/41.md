## Problem Summary
Given several words, determine if they can be arranged so that each word starts with the last letter of the previous word. All words must be used exactly once.

## Algorithm
1. Build a directed graph on 26 letters with edges from each word's first letter to its last.
2. Track in-degrees and out-degrees for each letter and use union-find to ensure all letters that appear belong to a single connected component (treating edges as undirected).
3. The arrangement is possible when the graph has an Euler path:
   - Either all letters have equal in- and out-degrees (Euler circuit), or
   - Exactly one letter has out-degree = in-degree + 1 and exactly one letter has in-degree = out-degree + 1 (Euler path).
4. If both the connectivity and degree conditions hold, print `Ordering is possible.`; otherwise print `The door cannot be opened.`

This runs in O(N) time for N words.
