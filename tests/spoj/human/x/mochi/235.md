# VFMUL - Very Fast Multiplication

[Problem statement](https://www.spoj.com/problems/VFMUL/)

## Algorithm
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case read a line containing two decimal numbers `a` and `b`.
3. Parse both numbers as arbitrary-precision integers (`bigint`).
4. Output the product `a * b`.

## Correctness
Casting each input string to `bigint` yields an exact representation of the number.
Multiplying the two `bigint` values therefore computes their exact product, which is printed for each case.

## Complexity Analysis
Let `n` and `m` be the number of digits of `a` and `b` respectively. The built-in `bigint`
multiplication runs in `O(n * m)` time and uses `O(n + m)` space.
