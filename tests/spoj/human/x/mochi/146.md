# [Fast Multiplication Again](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MULTIPLY/)

## Problem Summary
Read two positive integers, each on its own line, and output their product. The result is guaranteed to be less than 10000.

## Algorithm
1. Read the first integer `a`.
2. Read the second integer `b`.
3. Compute `a * b` and print it.

The algorithm performs a single multiplication and runs in constant time and space.
