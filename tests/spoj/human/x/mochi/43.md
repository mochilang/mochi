## Problem Summary
Given m books each with a number of pages p1..pm, distribute them to k scribes (k â‰¤ m) so that every scriber receives a contiguous sequence of books and the maximum pages assigned to any scriber is minimized. Output the sequence with slashes separating the k parts. Among optimal solutions, minimize the work of the first scriber, then the second, and so on, with each scriber getting at least one book.

## Algorithm
1. Binary search on the minimal possible maximum pages per scriber between the largest single book and the total sum.
2. For a candidate limit, greedily assign books from the start and count how many scribers are required if none exceeds the limit.
3. After locating the smallest feasible limit, reconstruct the partition from the end: begin a new scriber when adding the next book would exceed the limit or when the remaining books equal the remaining scribers.
4. Print books separated by spaces, inserting ` / ` at partition boundaries.

This runs in O(m log S) time per case with O(m) extra space for the partition markers, where S is the sum of pages.
