# [PANIC](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PANIC/)

- Run multi-source Dijkstra from all bomb locations to get the earliest panic time for each plaza.
- If any plaza is unreachable the answer is all such plazas since panic never arrives.
- For every street `(u,v)` with travel times `t_uv` and `t_vu`, compute the time when crowds meet:
  `(dist[u]*t_vu + dist[v]*t_uv + t_uv*t_vu)/(t_uv + t_vu)`.
- Track the maximum over all node times and meeting times. Start from all plazas that achieve this maximum and walk backwards along edges that lie on shortest paths (`dist[v] = dist[u] + w_uv`).
- All visited plazas form the answer; output them in increasing order.
