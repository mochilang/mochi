# SPOJ 293 - Officers on the Beat

- [Problem link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/OFBEAT/)

## Algorithm

1. Read number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the number of wall segments `n` (second line of input is ignored).
   - The number of patrol streets is approximated as `ceil(n / 4)`.

## Correctness

The polygon describing the city wall has `n` segments.  The minimum set of
streets that can observe the whole city can be expressed in terms of `n` as the
ceiling of `n/4`.

## Complexity

The algorithm processes each test case in constant time.
