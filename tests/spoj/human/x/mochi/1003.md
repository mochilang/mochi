# [Little Quilt](https://www.spoj.com/problems/QUILT)

## Problem Summary
Implement an interpreter for the Little Quilt language with grammar:
`<QUILT> ::= A | B | turn(<QUILT>) | sew(<QUILT>,<QUILT>)`.
A and B are primitive 2×2 quilts:
A = `//` over `/+`; B = `--` over `--`.
`turn` rotates a quilt 90° clockwise with character mapping `-`↔`|`, `/`↔`\`, `+`→`+`.
`sew` concatenates two quilts of equal height; otherwise it produces an error.
Each expression ends with `;` and whitespace is ignored.

## Algorithm
1. Read entire input, strip all whitespace.
2. Recursively parse expressions per grammar.
3. For `turn`, rotate the matrix using the character mapping.
4. For `sew`, verify equal heights then join corresponding rows.
5. After each expression, output `Quilt i:` followed by the quilt rows or `error` if any operation failed.

Time complexity is proportional to the number of characters in the resulting quilt.
