# [Fake tournament](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TOUR)

## Problem Summary
Given known match outcomes between participants in an elimination tournament, determine how many players can be scheduled to win by only playing opponents they defeat.

## Algorithm
1. Build a directed graph where an edge `a -> b` means `a` beats `b`.
2. For each player `x`:
   - Perform BFS starting from `x` following edges to players `x` can beat (directly or indirectly).
   - Check that every player who beats `x` is reachable from `x` in this graph.
   - If all such players are reachable, `x` can win; increment the answer.
3. Output the count of players that can be champions.

Each BFS runs in `O(n + m)` time with `n` players and `m` known results, giving overall `O(n*(n+m))` per test case.
