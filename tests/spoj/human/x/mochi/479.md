## Problem Summary
For each test case we are given three values: `n`, `index` and `m`. Consider all permutations of the numbers `1..n` listed in lexicographical order using zero‑based indexing. Starting from the permutation at position `index`, output `m` successive permutations, wrapping around to the first permutation if necessary. Separate different test cases with a blank line.

## Algorithm
1. To obtain the permutation for a given index `k`, express `k` in the **factorial number system**:
   - Repeatedly for `i = 1 .. n` compute `digit = k % i` and `k = k / i`. The collected digits describe the factoradic representation of `k` (equivalent to `k mod n!`).
2. Build the permutation from these digits:
   - Start with the ordered list `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - For `i` from `n` down to `1`, select the `digit`th remaining element and append it to the result, removing it from the list.
3. For each test case compute the permutation for `index`, `index+1`, …, `index+m-1` using the above procedure and print them.

The conversion and construction are both `O(n)` per permutation, so the total complexity is `O(m * n)` per test case, which easily meets the constraints (`n ≤ 100`, `m ≤ 100`).
