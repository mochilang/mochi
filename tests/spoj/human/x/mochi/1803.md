# [Fold](https://www.spoj.com/problems/FOLD/)

## Problem Summary
Given a string of `A` and `V` describing the folds of a paper strip after it has been completely unfolded. The folded strip has the length of one stripe. Determine the minimal number of folding steps required to produce the given pattern.

## Algorithm
1. Recursively evaluate the fold string with memoization.
2. For every position `i` (between characters), test whether folding there is valid by checking pairs of characters equidistant from the fold. A fold is valid only if all mirrored pairs match (`A` with `A` and `V` with `V`).
3. For a valid fold, fold the shorter side onto the longer side, removing the overlapped portion, and recursively solve the remaining string.
4. Return `1 +` the minimal result among all valid folds.
5. Base cases: empty string requires `0` folds, a single character requires `1` fold.

The memoization ensures each substring is processed once, yielding time complexity `O(n^2)` for `n < 200`.
