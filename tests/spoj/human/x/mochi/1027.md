# [Fool the Police](https://www.spoj.com/problems/FPOLICE/)

## Problem Summary
Given `N` police stations and a complete graph of travel times and risk values between stations, start at station `1` and reach station `N` (airport) within a maximum time `T`. Minimize total risk; if multiple paths have the same minimal risk, choose the one with the smallest travel time. If no path fits in time `T`, output `-1`.

## Algorithm
1. Use dynamic programming over time. Create `dp[node][time]` representing the minimal risk to reach `node` in exactly `time` units.
2. Initialize all entries to `INF` except `dp[0][0] = 0`.
3. For each time `t` from `0` to `T` and each node `u`, relax transitions to every node `v`:
   - Let `tcost` be the travel time and `rcost` be the risk from `u` to `v`.
   - If `t + tcost ≤ T`, update `dp[v][t + tcost] = min(dp[v][t + tcost], dp[u][t] + rcost)`.
4. After filling the table, scan `dp[N-1][t]` for `0 ≤ t ≤ T` to find the minimal risk and corresponding smallest time.
5. Output the risk and time, or `-1` if unreachable.

The state space is `N × (T+1)` (≤ 100 × 251), so the complexity is about `O(N^2 * T)`.
