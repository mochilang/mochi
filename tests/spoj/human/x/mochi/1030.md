## Problem Summary
Given `k`, find the k-th positive integer whose cube ends with the digits `888`.
There may be up to 2·10^12 such `k` values across multiple test cases.

## Algorithm
Observe the sequence of numbers whose cubes end with `888`:
`192, 442, 692, 942, ...`.
The difference between successive terms is always `250`.
This pattern follows from modular arithmetic: solving `n^3 ≡ 888 (mod 1000)`
yields `n ≡ 192 (mod 250)`.
Thus the k-th term is simply:

```
answer = 250 * k - 58
```

For each test case read `k`, compute this formula, and output the result.
The computation uses 64-bit integers and runs in O(t) time for `t` test cases.
