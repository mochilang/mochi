# GREED - Greedy island

Given `N` cards where card labels range between `1` and `N`, we may exchange a card labeled `x` for a card labeled `y` at cost `1` if the pair `(x, y)` is allowed. Exchanges are bidirectional and may be chained. The goal is to obtain exactly one card of each label `1..N` with minimum total exchange cost.

### Algorithm
1. Build an undirected graph on vertices `1..N` using the allowed exchanges.
2. For every vertex perform a breadth‑first search to obtain the minimum number of exchanges needed to change one label into another.
3. Count occurrences of each label in the current hand. Labels with count greater than one are surplus; labels with count `0` are deficits.
4. Construct a cost matrix where each surplus card is matched to each deficit label using the BFS distances.
5. Apply the Hungarian algorithm to this matrix to find the minimum total cost to cover all deficits.
6. Output this minimal cost for each test case.

The BFS phase is `O(N*(N+E))` and the Hungarian algorithm runs in `O(K^3)` where `K` is the number of cards that must be changed (at most `N ≤ 500`).
