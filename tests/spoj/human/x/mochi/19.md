## Problem Summary
Given the number of positive integers that cannot be expressed as `a*p + b*q` for non-negative integers `a` and `b` with prime `p` and `q`, compute the count of integers less than `p*q` that are coprime to `p*q`.

## Algorithm
- For two distinct primes `p` and `q`, the number of non-representable positive integers is `(p-1)*(q-1)/2` (Frobenius coin problem).
- The value `u = phi(p*q) = (p-1)*(q-1)` therefore equals twice the provided number.
- Since the input may contain up to 99 digits, treat it as a string and implement decimal doubling manually.

The algorithm runs in `O(L)` time where `L` is the number of digits.
