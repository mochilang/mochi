# [Vonny and her dominos](https://www.spoj.com/problems/VONNY/)

## Problem Summary
Given a 7×8 grid filled with numbers 0–6, count how many ways the grid can be tiled using the 28 tiles of a standard domino set. Each domino covers two adjacent squares and is labeled with a pair of numbers (i,j) with 0 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ 6. Each domino may be used at most once, and it can only be placed over two adjacent squares if the numbers on those squares match the domino's labels (order irrelevant).

## Algorithm
1. **Parse Input:** For each test case read the 7×8 grid (56 integers).
2. **Backtracking:**
   - Maintain arrays for the grid, a boolean mask of used squares, and a boolean mask for the 28 domino types.
   - Find the first unused square scanning left‑to‑right, top‑to‑bottom.
   - Try to place a domino horizontally or vertically if the neighboring square is unused and the corresponding domino type has not been used yet.
   - Mark the two squares and the domino type as used and recurse to place the remaining dominoes. After recursion, undo the marks.
3. **Count Tilings:** Each time the recursion covers all 56 squares a valid tiling is found; increment the count.

This depth‑first search with pruning explores only valid placements. The search space is limited by the small board and unique domino set, so it finishes quickly.
