# Outside it is now raining (RAIN2)

For each umbrella we model the movement of its left edge.  The umbrella moves
at constant speed until it hits the street boundary, then reverses direction.
This produces a list of time segments where the position of the edge is a linear
function `p(t) = a*t + b`.

All times when the covered set of the street may change are collected:
segment start/end times and any moments when an edge of one umbrella meets an
edge of another.  Between two consecutive events the order of all edges is
fixed, so the total covered length varies linearly.

For every interval `[t_i, t_{i+1}]` we evaluate the union of all umbrella
intervals at both ends, compute the area of the trapezoid, and sum these areas.
The rain reaching the ground is `V * (W*T - covered_area)`.

This algorithm runs in `O(N^2 * S^2)` time where `S` is the number of movement
segments of an umbrella and works comfortably within the constraints.
