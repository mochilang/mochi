## Problem Summary
Given train schedules for several cities, find the route that allows Jill to travel from a starting city to a destination as early as possible. If several connections arrive at the same earliest time, choose the one that departs the starting city as late as possible.

## Algorithm
1. Treat every `(city, time)` pair from the schedules as an event node.
2. For each train, connect consecutive stops to model travelling along the train.
3. For each city, sort its events by time and connect each to the next so waiting is possible.
4. Insert a virtual event at the given start time in the starting city.
5. Run Dijkstra on this acyclic time graph. Each state also keeps the departure time from the start city; when leaving the start city for the first time, this value is set and propagated.
6. Among all events in the destination city reached, choose the one with earliest arrival; break ties by larger departure time.

The approach runs in `O(E log V)` where `E` is the number of edges between events.
