## Problem Summary
The cave forms a directed acyclic graph of chambers numbered from 1 (top) to n (bottom). Corridors go from a lower-numbered chamber to a higher-numbered one. Each speleologist must leave chamber 1 using a unique corridor and enter chamber n through a unique corridor, while all other corridors may be reused. Determine the maximum number of speleologists that can traverse simultaneously.

## Algorithm
1. Collect the direct neighbors of chamber 1 (`L`) and the chambers that connect directly to chamber n (`R`).
2. For each `u` in `L`, run BFS through the cave to find which chambers are reachable from `u`.
   - For every reachable chamber `v` in `R`, add an edge `(u, v)` in a bipartite graph.
3. Run a DFS-based augmenting path algorithm to compute the maximum bipartite matching between `L` and `R`.
4. The size of the matching equals the maximum number of speleologists that can train simultaneously.

All internal corridors can be shared, so only the unique start/end corridors matter. With `n â‰¤ 200`, BFS for each start and the simple matching algorithm run quickly.
