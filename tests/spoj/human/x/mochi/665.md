# [String it out](https://www.spoj.com/problems/SUBS/)

## Problem Summary
Given strings `X` and `Y` consisting of lowercase letters, define `XM` as the string
produced by repeating each character of `X` exactly `M` times.
For each test case determine the largest `M` such that `XM` is a subsequence of `Y`.

## Algorithm
1. Binary search the answer `M` in `[0, len(Y)/len(X)]`.
2. To test a candidate `M`, scan through `Y` while tracking the position
   in `X` and how many copies of the current character have been matched.
   Every time we see the needed character, increment the counter; when it
   reaches `M`, advance to the next character of `X`.
3. If the whole of `X` is consumed, `XM` is a subsequence.

The search returns the maximum `M` for which `XM` fits in `Y`.

Complexity: `O(|Y| log |Y|)` time and `O(1)` additional memory per test case.
