# SUDOKU - Sudoku

The task is to solve up to ten 16×16 Sudoku grids. Cells contain letters
`A`‒`P` or `-` for an empty cell. Each row, column and 4×4 sub‑square must
contain every letter exactly once.

## Algorithm

1. **Input** – read the number of puzzles and load each grid into a
   16×16 array of characters.
2. **Backtracking** – recursively process cells from left to right, top to
   bottom:
   - Skip filled cells.
   - For an empty cell try each letter `A`…`P`. A candidate is valid if it
     is absent from the cell's row, column and its 4×4 box (checked by
     scanning those ranges).
   - Place the letter and recurse to the next cell. If the deeper call
     fails, reset the cell to `-` and continue with the next letter.
3. **Output** – after solving, print the completed grid. Separate test cases
   with a blank line.

This depth‑first search with simple validity checks is sufficient for the
problem constraints and solves the provided example quickly.
