## Problem Summary
Given two configurations of four identical pieces on an 8x8 board, determine whether the second configuration can be reached from the first in at most eight moves. A move consists of moving a piece to an adjacent empty square or jumping over an adjacent piece to the next empty square (up, down, left or right).

## Algorithm
1. Encode a configuration as four cell indices `(row*8 + column)` sorted ascending so that piece identities do not matter.
2. Perform breadth-first search (BFS) from the start configuration exploring states up to depth 8.
   - For each state, generate all legal moves:
     * Move a piece to an adjacent empty square.
     * Jump over a neighboring piece to an empty square two steps away.
   - Skip configurations already visited.
3. If the target configuration is encountered during the BFS, output `YES`; otherwise output `NO`.

The board has at most \(\binom{64}{4}\) states, so BFS with depth limit 8 runs quickly.
