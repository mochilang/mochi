# [Square Root](https://www.spoj.com/problems/SQRROOT/)

## Problem Summary
Given up to 50 test cases, each containing a positive integer with up to 800 digits that is guaranteed to be a perfect square. For each number output its exact integer square root.

## Algorithm
1. Parse each input number as a `bigint`.
2. Perform binary search to find the root:
   - Initialise `low = 1` and `high = n`.
   - While `low <= high`:
     - `mid = (low + high) / 2`.
     - Compare `mid * mid` with `n`.
     - If equal, `mid` is the square root.
     - If less, search the upper half (`low = mid + 1`); otherwise search the lower half (`high = mid - 1`).
3. Output the found `mid` for each test case.

Binary search uses `O(log n)` bigint multiplications, which is efficient even for 800-digit numbers.
