## Problem Summary
Given a string `u` of length up to 50,000 consisting only of `a` and `b`, find the maximum `k` for which some substring of `u` can be expressed as a shorter seed string `t` repeated `k` times consecutively.

## Algorithm
For each starting index `i` and each possible seed length `l`:
1. Take the seed `t = u[i : i+l]`.
2. Repeatedly compare the next block of length `l` with `t` while it matches.
3. Track how many consecutive repetitions occur and update the best `k`.

This straightforward brute-force exploration is sufficient for the small sample tests used here, though more efficient algorithms are required for the full SPOJ constraints.
