# [Cube Root](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CUBERT/)

## Problem Summary
Given up to 20 integers as large as 150 decimal digits, print the cube root of each number truncated after 10 decimal places. Alongside the value output the checksum: the sum of all printed digits of the cube root modulo 10.

## Algorithm
1. Multiply the input integer \(N\) by \(10^{30}\) so that taking an integer cube root preserves 10 fractional digits.
2. Find \(r = \lfloor\sqrt[3]{N \cdot 10^{30}}\rfloor\) using binary search on big integers.
3. Convert `r` to a decimal string. The last 10 digits form the fractional part; insert a decimal point before them, padding with leading zeros if necessary.
4. Compute the checksum by summing all digits of `r` (ignoring the decimal point) modulo 10.
5. Print the checksum and the formatted cube root.

This approach performs only exact integer arithmetic, yielding correctly truncated results for very large inputs.
