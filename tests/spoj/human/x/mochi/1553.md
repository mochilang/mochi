## Problem Summary
Given `n` offices on a straight street (positions sorted), choose `k` disjoint pairs of offices so that each office is used in at most one pair and the sum of distances within pairs is minimal.

## Algorithm
Since offices are placed on a line and sorted, an optimal solution pairs offices that are adjacent among the chosen set. Thus we only need to consider edges between consecutive offices. We select `k` non-overlapping edges with minimal total weight.

Dynamic programming:
- `dp[i][j]` – minimal cost using the first `i` offices and forming `j` pairs.
- Transition:
  - Skip office `i`: `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j])`.
  - Pair offices `i-1` and `i` (if `i ≥ 2` and `j > 0`): `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-2][j-1] + a[i]-a[i-1])`.
- Initialize `dp[0][0] = 0` and others to infinity.

The final answer is `dp[n][k]`. The implementation uses rolling arrays to keep memory `O(k)` and runs in `O(nk)` time.
