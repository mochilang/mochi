# [Will Indiana Jones Get There](https://www.spoj.com/problems/WIJGT/)

## Problem Summary
Given a set of axis-aligned wall segments in the plane, the first segment contains Indiana Jones and the second contains the trapped person. Indiana can walk along the walls and may place a wooden board between any two walls to cross the gap. Determine the minimal board length that allows him to reach the person.

## Algorithm
1. Parse each wall section into a segment represented by its bounding box `(minx, maxx, miny, maxy)`.
2. Pre-compute the Euclidean distance between every pair of segments using
   `dx = max(0, max(a.minx, b.minx) - min(a.maxx, b.maxx))` and similar for `dy`.
   The distance is `sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2)`.
3. Treat each segment as a node in a complete graph with edge weights equal to the distances.
4. Run a variant of Dijkstra where the path cost is the maximum edge weight seen so far. 
   This finds the path minimizing the required board length from start to target.
5. Output the resulting minimal board length rounded to two decimals.

The solution runs in `O(n^2)` time for `n â‰¤ 1000` segments.
