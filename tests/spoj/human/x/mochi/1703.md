## Problem Summary
Given a list of insignificant words and several abbreviation/phrase pairs, determine how many different ways each abbreviation can be formed from the corresponding phrase. Letters must appear in order, insignificant words are ignored, and every remaining word must contribute at least one letter. If no assignments satisfy the rules, the abbreviation is invalid.

## Algorithm
1. Read the list of insignificant words for the current scenario.
2. For each test case:
   - Separate the abbreviation and phrase and remove insignificant words from the phrase.
   - Let `A` be the abbreviation in lowercase and `W` the list of remaining words.
   - Use dynamic programming. `dp[j]` is the number of ways to match the first `j` letters of `A` using the processed words.
   - For each word `w` in `W`, compute how many subsequences of `w` can produce each possible suffix of `A`, then update `dp` accordingly ensuring at least one letter from `w` is used.
3. After processing all words, `dp[len(A)]` is the number of valid formations. Output the count or report an invalid abbreviation if it is zero.

This algorithm runs in `O(n * L * m)` time where `n` is the number of significant words, `L` is the abbreviation length, and `m` is the average word length.
