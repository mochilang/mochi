## Problem Summary
Given `n` students and `n` topics, an `n x n` matrix indicates which student likes which topic (1 = likes). Each topic can be assigned to at most one student. For each test case, count the number of ways to assign topics so that every student receives exactly one topic they like.

## Algorithm
1. Use a bitmask dynamic programming over topic assignments.
2. `dp[mask]` stores the number of ways to assign topics represented by `mask` to the first `k` students, where `k` is the number of set bits in `mask`.
3. For each mask, try giving the next student any liked topic not yet used, updating `dp[mask | (1 << topic)] += dp[mask]`.
4. The answer for a test case is `dp[(1 << n) - 1]`.

This explores all subsets in `O(n * 2^n)` time, which is feasible for `n â‰¤ 20`.
