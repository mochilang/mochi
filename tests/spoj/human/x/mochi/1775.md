# SPOJ 1775 - Boolean Logic

1. **Parsing**
   - Scan the expression while ignoring spaces.
   - Build a tree.  Each node stores its operator/variable, the position of
     its center character in the original string and indices of children.
   - For multi-character operators (`-->`, `<->`) the middle hyphen is used as
     the position.
   - Collect every distinct variable.

2. **Assignment enumeration**
   - Sort the variables alphabetically.
   - Recursively assign `0` and `1` to each variable so that the first variable
     changes slowest, producing the required ordering of `2^n` assignments.

3. **Evaluation and printing**
   - For each assignment evaluate the tree recursively, storing the value of
     every node.
   - Create a blank output line of the same length as the input and place the
     value (`0`/`1`) of each node at its recorded position.
   - Print all lines, preceded by the original expression and followed by a
     blank line.
