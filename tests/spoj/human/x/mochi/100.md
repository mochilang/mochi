# [Tower of Babylon](https://www.spoj.com/problems/BABTWR/)

## Problem Summary
Given up to 30 types of blocks, each with dimensions `x`, `y`, and `z`. Any number of blocks of each type may be used and blocks
may be rotated so any side can be the height. A block can be placed on top of another only if both of its base sides are strictly
smaller than the corresponding sides of the block below. For each test case, terminated by `n = 0`, output the maximum possible
tower height.

## Algorithm
1. For every block, generate three orientations by choosing each dimension as the height and sorting the remaining two to form the
   base (`width >= depth`).
2. Collect all orientations and sort them in **descending** order by base area (`width * depth`).
3. Use dynamic programming similar to a 2‑D longest increasing subsequence:
   - `dp[i]` – maximum tower height ending with orientation `i` on top.
   - Initialize `dp[i]` with its own height.
   - For each pair `j < i`, if orientation `i` fits on `j` (both base sides smaller), update `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + height_i)`.
4. The answer is the maximum value in `dp`.

With at most `3n <= 90` orientations, the `O(m^2)` DP is easily fast enough.
