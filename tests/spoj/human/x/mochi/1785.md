## Problem Summary
Given an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 6), produce a digit sequence of length `10^n + n - 1` that contains every possible `n`-digit string over `0…9` exactly once as a contiguous substring. Inputs consist of multiple values of `n` terminated by `0`.

## Algorithm
The task is to generate a De Bruijn sequence of order `n` over the digits `0…9`. We use the classic recursive algorithm:

1. Maintain an array `a` and an output list `seq`.
2. Recursively build Lyndon words via function `db(t, p)`:
   - If `t > n` and `n` is divisible by `p`, append `a[1:p]` to `seq`.
   - Otherwise set `a[t] = a[t - p]`, recurse with `(t+1, p)`, and try larger digits `j` from `a[t - p] + 1` to `9` with recursion `(t+1, t)`.
3. After generating `seq` (length `10^n`), append its first `n-1` digits to close the cycle.

This yields a sequence containing each `n`-digit code exactly once while using only `10^n + n - 1` digits.
