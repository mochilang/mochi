## Problem Summary
Agnes and Tom each run through a sequence of checkpoints described by numbers. Agnes runs a fixed route, while Tom can choose from several possible routes. Tom scores a point each time he meets Agnes at the same checkpoint and must move to the next checkpoint on his route after each meeting. For each dataset, find the maximum number of meetings Tom can achieve among his proposed routes.

## Algorithm
The problem reduces to computing the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between Agnes's route and each of Tom's routes. The length of the LCS gives the number of meetings for that pair of routes. For each dataset:

1. Read Agnes's route as a sequence of integers terminated by 0.
2. For each of Tom's routes (also terminated by 0 and a line starting with 0 ends the dataset):
   - Compute the LCS length with Agnes's route using dynamic programming with two rows of size `m+1` (where `m` is Tom's route length).
   - Track the maximum LCS length over all Tom routes.
3. Output the maximum value.

The LCS dynamic programming runs in `O(n * m)` time for sequences of length up to 2000, and the two-row optimization keeps memory usage at `O(m)`.
