## Problem Summary
Find all quadruples of prices `a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d` (each with two decimal places and at least €0.01) such that the product of the four prices equals their sum and the sum does not exceed €20.00. Output every valid combination in non-decreasing order, each on its own line.

## Algorithm
1. Work in integer cents to avoid floating point issues. The constraint `a + b + c + d = (a * b * c * d) / 10^6` becomes `a*b*c*d = (a+b+c+d) * 10^6`.
2. Enumerate `a`, `b`, and `c` in nested loops with the following pruning:
   - `a` from 1 while `4*a ≤ 2000` (since `a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d` and total ≤ 2000).
   - `b` from `a` while `a + 3*b ≤ 2000`.
   - `c` from `b` while `a + b + 2*c ≤ 2000`.
3. For each triple compute:
   - `sum = a + b + c`
   - `prod = a * b * c`
   - `denom = prod - 1,000,000`; if `denom ≤ 0` skip.
   - `d = (sum * 1,000,000) / denom` if divisible; ensure `d ≥ c` and `sum + d ≤ 2000`.
4. Verify `prod * d == (sum + d) * 1,000,000` and output the four prices formatted with two decimals.

This brute-force search runs quickly because the bounds restrict the loops to at most a few hundred iterations per dimension.
