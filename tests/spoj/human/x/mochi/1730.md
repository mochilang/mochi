# TCOUNT2 - Counting Triangles II

A level `N` hexagon is formed by joining six level `N` triangles in a triangular lattice.
Every triangle inside the hexagon has its sides parallel to the lattice directions.

The number of such triangles depends on the parity of `N`.
For even `N = 2k` and odd `N = 2k+1` the counts are:

```
F(2k)   = 28 k^3 + 9 k^2 + k
F(2k+1) = 28 k^3 + 51 k^2 + 31 k + 6
```

Both expressions can be combined into a single formula:

```
F(N) = (14*N^3 + 9*N^2 + 2*N - (N % 2)) / 4
```

The computation uses 64-bit integers and runs in constant time per test case.
