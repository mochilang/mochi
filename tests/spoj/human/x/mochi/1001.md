## Problem Summary
Given the initial pot `P0`, the bet amount `b`, and the final pot `Pf` for a day of a roulette game, determine whether the result is possible. Each turn changes the pot by `L*b` where `L` is one of `-3,-2,-1,1,2,3`; positive values add to the pot while negative values subtract. If a subtraction would make the pot negative the player takes the largest multiple of the bet not exceeding the pot. The game stops when the pot falls below the bet. For valid triples output the minimal number of players needed, otherwise print `No accounting tablet`.

## Algorithm
1. The pot is always congruent to `P0 mod b`. If `Pf mod b` differs the record is invalid.
2. If `Pf â‰¥ b`, the difference `(Pf-P0)/b` gives the net multiples of the bet added or removed. Each turn can change the pot by up to 3 multiples, so the minimal players is `ceil(|(Pf-P0)/b|/3)`.
3. If `Pf < b`, it must equal `P0 mod b`. Let `q = P0 / b`. Consider the last turn removing `k` multiples for `k = 1..min(3,q)`. The remaining `q-k` multiples require `ceil((q-k)/3)` previous players; add one for the final player and take the minimum.
4. Output that minimum, or `No accounting tablet` if none of the above conditions are met.

This runs in constant time and space per test case.
