# SPOJ 1457 - Help Blue Mary Please! (Act I)

The original equations contain only the symbols `0-9`, `+`, `*` and `=`.  Each of these
was replaced by a distinct letter from `a` to `m`.  Given the encoded equations we
must recover which letters are forced to correspond to which symbols.

Algorithm outline:

1. Collect the set of letters occurring in the given equations and find the
   letters that appear exactly once in every equation – one of these must be the
   replacement for `=`.
2. For every candidate `=` letter run a depth‑first search that assigns the
   remaining letters to the remaining symbols (digits, `+` or `*`).  The search
   considers only one‑to‑one mappings and checks every complete assignment by
   translating the equations and evaluating them with normal arithmetic
   precedence.
3. Every valid assignment contributes the discovered letter→symbol pairs.  After
   exploring all candidates we keep only the pairs that are identical in all
   solutions and output them in lexicographic order.  If no assignment satisfies
   the equations we print `noway`.

This brute force search is feasible because at most a few different letters
appear in the test cases.
