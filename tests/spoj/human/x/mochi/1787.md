# [Run Length Encoding](https://www.spoj.com/problems/ENCONDIN/)

## Problem Summary
For each input line, produce a run‑length encoding:
- Runs of 2–9 identical characters become two characters: the count (digit `2`–`9`) followed by the character. Runs longer than nine are emitted in blocks of nine, then the remainder.
- Other sequences with no consecutive repeats are wrapped as `1` + sequence + `1`. Any literal `1` inside the sequence is escaped as `11`.
- Newlines are copied directly.

## Algorithm
1. Scan each line left to right.
2. Maintain a buffer for the current non-repeating sequence.
3. When a run of length ≥2 is found:
   - Flush the buffer as `1` + escaped buffer + `1`.
   - Emit `9<ch>` blocks while the run is ≥9.
   - Output the remaining run (2–9) as `<len><ch>`; if one character remains, append it to the buffer.
4. Continue scanning; after the line ends, flush any remaining buffer.

The escape step replaces every `1` with `11`.

## Complexity
Let `n` be the line length. Each character is examined a constant number of times, giving `O(n)` time and `O(n)` output size per line.
