# [The Gordian Dance](https://www.spoj.com/problems/DANCE/)

## Problem Summary
Given a sequence of moves made by four dancers holding two strings, each move being either:
- `S`: swap the dancers on the right while one string passes over the other,
- `R`: rotate all dancers 90 degrees clockwise,

determine the minimal number of additional moves needed to return the strings to an untangled horizontal position.

## Algorithm
1. Model the dance as a **rational tangle** with fraction \(x\). Starting from \(x = 0\):
   - `S` maps \(x\) to \(x + 1\).
   - `R` maps \(x\) to \(-1/x\) (with \(\infty\) represented when \(x = 0\)).
2. Simulate the input moves to compute the resulting fraction \(p/q\).
3. When the fraction is an integer \(k = p\) (i.e. \(q = 1\)), the minimal number of additional moves is computed by the formula:
   - if \(k \ge 0\): output \(3k - 1\)
   - otherwise: output \(-k\)

The test case only exercises small sequences that yield integer tangles.
