# Hangover (SPOJ HANGOVER)

The overhang produced by stacking `n` cards is:

```
H(n) = 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/(n+1)
```

Given a desired overhang `c`, we seek the smallest `n` such that `H(n) >= c`.

## Algorithm
1. Read each floating point value `c` until `0.00`.
2. For each `c`, incrementally sum the series `1/(k+1)` starting from `k=1`
   until the accumulated sum is at least `c`. The number of terms summed is
   the minimal number of cards required.
3. Output `"<n> card(s)"`.

The maximum `c` is 5.20, so at most a few hundred iterations are needed per
query. Each test case runs in O(n) where `n` is the resulting number of cards
(â‰ˆ273 for the largest case).
