# MDST - Minimum Diameter Spanning Tree

For each test graph we need the smallest diameter among all spanning trees.

Let `ecc(v)` be the farthest distance from vertex `v` to any other vertex and let
`r = min_v ecc(v)` be the radius of the graph.  The minimum diameter of a
spanning tree of an unweighted graph is always either `2*r` or `2*r - 1`.
If there exist two center vertices (vertices with `ecc(v) = r`) that are
adjacent in the original graph, then a spanning tree of diameter `2*r - 1`
can be constructed.  Otherwise the best we can do is `2*r`.

Algorithm

1. Run BFS from every vertex to compute all eccentricities.
2. Determine the radius `r` and collect all center vertices.
3. Check whether any two centers are connected by an edge.  If yes and
   `r > 0`, the answer is `2*r - 1`; otherwise it is `2*r`.

The complexity is `O(n (n + m))` using BFS for each vertex, which is feasible
for `n â‰¤ 1000`.
