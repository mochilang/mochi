# [Small factorials](https://www.spoj.com/problems/FCTRL2/)

## Problem Summary
Given `t` test cases, each with a positive integer `n \le 100`, compute and print `n!`.

## Algorithm
1. For each test case, initialise a bigint result `r = 1`.
2. For `i` from `2` to `n`, multiply `r` by `i` (cast `i` to bigint).
3. Output `r` as the factorial of `n`.

The loop performs `O(n)` multiplications per test case and uses big integers to avoid overflow.
