# [Complete the Sequence!](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CMPLS/)

## Problem Summary
Given the first `S` terms of a sequence that follows some polynomial, compute the next `C` terms of the sequence. Among all polynomials that fit the given values, choose the one with the lowest degree.

## Algorithm
1. Build a forward difference table from the known sequence.
   - `level[0]` holds the original sequence.
   - `level[k+1][i] = level[k][i+1] - level[k][i]` until the last level has length 1.
2. To extend the sequence, repeat the following `C` times:
   - Append the last value of the deepest level to itself (since it is constant).
   - For each higher level moving upward, append the sum of its last value and the newly appended value from the level below.
   - The newly appended value at the top level is the next term of the sequence.
3. Output the `C` generated terms.

This process corresponds to evaluating the unique minimal-degree polynomial using finite differences. Building the table costs `O(S^2)` time, and extending by `C` terms costs `O((S+C) * degree)`.
