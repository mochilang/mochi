## Problem Summary
Read integers from standard input and print each one on its own line until encountering the value `42`. The sentinel `42` and any following numbers are ignored.

## Algorithm
1. Iterate through lines of standard input.
2. Convert each line to an integer.
3. If the integer equals `42`, terminate the program.
4. Otherwise, output the integer followed by a newline.

This approach runs in linear time relative to the number of input values and uses constant additional space.
