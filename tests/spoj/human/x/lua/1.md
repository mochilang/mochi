## Problem Summary
Read integers from standard input and print them one per line until the value `42` is encountered. The sentinel `42` and any
subsequent numbers are not printed.

## Algorithm
1. Repeatedly read an integer using `io.read("*n")`.
2. If the read fails (EOF) or the integer is `42`, stop.
3. Otherwise, output the integer followed by a newline.

The algorithm runs in linear time in the number of input values and uses constant extra memory.
