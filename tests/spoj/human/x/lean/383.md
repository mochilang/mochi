# EUROPEAN - European railroad tracks

We must place the fewest rails so that every required gauge distance occurs between some pair of rails.  The first rail is fixed at position `0` and at most five rails are needed.

## Algorithm

* Deduplicate the requested gauges and compute an upper bound `L = 2 * max(gauge)` for rail positions.
* Try rail counts `k = 1..5`.  For each `k` perform depth-first search:
  * Maintain the current sorted rail positions (initially `[0]`).
  * If all gauges appear as differences between existing rails we are done.
  * If the number of rails reaches `k` and some gauge is missing, backtrack.
  * Pick an unsatisfied gauge `g` and generate candidates `r + g` for every existing rail `r`.
    Each candidate within the limit and not already used is inserted and the search recurses.
* When a solution is found the positions are returned; otherwise the search continues with a larger `k`.

The search space is tiny (`k â‰¤ 5` and at most eight gauges), so this simple backtracking approach is fast enough.
