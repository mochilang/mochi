## Problem Summary
In the city of Buscelona, each bus driver starts with unique news. Bus lines are circular,
and moving between consecutive stops takes one minute. Whenever several drivers are at the
same stop simultaneously they exchange everything they know. For each set of bus lines we
must determine how many minutes it takes until all drivers know all news, or report
`NEVER` if that never occurs.

## Algorithm
1. Read the bus routes and compute the length of each.
2. Their positions repeat after the least common multiple of these lengths. This period
   bounds the simulation.
3. Represent each driver's knowledge as a bit mask; initially bit `i` is set only for
   driver `i`.
4. For every minute from `0` up to the period:
   - compute each driver's current stop,
   - if two drivers share a stop, merge their masks via bitwise OR,
   - after processing all pairs, if every mask equals `(1 << n) - 1`, output the minute.
5. If the loop finishes without all knowing everything, output `NEVER`.

The masks only grow, so failure to meet within one full period implies it will never
happen.
