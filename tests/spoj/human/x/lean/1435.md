# PT07X - Vertex Cover

We are given a tree with up to 100000 vertices and must find the size of the smallest vertex set that touches every edge.

Root the tree at node 1. For each node `v` we compute two DP values:

- `include[v]`: minimum cover size of the subtree when `v` is included.
- `exclude[v]`: minimum cover size when `v` is excluded.

For every child `u` of `v`:

- If `v` is included, edge `(v,u)` is already covered, so child `u` may be included or not. We add `min(include[u], exclude[u])`.
- If `v` is excluded, every edge `(v,u)` must be covered by `u`, so we add `include[u]`.

We traverse the tree iteratively to avoid recursion limits, first generating a parent array and post-order list using a stack. Then we process nodes in reverse order to fill the DP arrays.

The answer is `min(include[root], exclude[root])`. Complexity is `O(N)`.
