# Continuous Fractions

[Problem link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CFRAC/)

Given a rational number `p / q` with `p > q > 0`, we must print its simple
continued fraction in a particular ASCII-art form.

## Algorithm

1. Generate the simple continued fraction coefficients of `p / q` using the
   Euclidean algorithm.  If the last coefficient is not `1`, decrease it by one
   and append a final `1` to satisfy the problem's uniqueness requirement.
2. Recursively build the ASCII representation:
   - Base case `[1]` renders as a single line `"1"`.
   - For `[a₀, tail]` with previously rendered tail (width `w`):
     * width = `len(a₀) + 3 + w`.
     * The first line centers `1` above the tail.
     * The second line prints `a₀.+.` followed by a bar of `w` dashes.
     * Each line of the tail is prefixed with `len(a₀) + 3` periods to shift it
       right under the bar.
3. For each input pair, output the case header, `p / q`, and the constructed
   lines.

The number of output lines is `2n - 1` for `n` coefficients, matching the sample
format.
