# SPOJ PLATON - Platon and Socrates

Platon is told the product of two distinct numbers in a given range
while Socrates is told their sum.  Their conversation is:

1. Platon: *I don't know the numbers.*
2. Socrates: *I knew you couldn't know; I don't know either.*
3. Platon: *Now I know the numbers.*
4. Socrates: *Now I know them too.*

For each query range `[l,r]` we must list all pairs `(a,b)` (with
`l ≤ a < b ≤ r`) consistent with this dialogue.

### Algorithm

* Enumerate all pairs and record their sum and product.
* **Step 1:**  Keep only products that occur more than once – otherwise
  Platon would know immediately.
* **Step 2:**  A sum is valid only if it contains at least two pairs and
  **all** of them have ambiguous products.  These are the sums for which
  Socrates knew Platon could not know.
* **Step 3:**  From the remaining pairs keep those whose product occurs
  only once; after Socrates' remark Platon can now identify the pair.
* **Step 4:**  Finally keep pairs whose sum occurs only once among the
  survivors so that Socrates can also deduce the pair.  Output pairs
  sorted by increasing sum.

The range width is below 200, so the brute force enumeration of all
pairs is easily fast enough.
