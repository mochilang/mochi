# SPOJ HOTLINE - Hotline

The program implements the **Adaptive Automatic Answering Algorithm**.  
It keeps every statement of the dialogue together with its subject, verb and
object.  Each verb–object pair represents a unique activity.  The input may
also contain special subjects `everybody` (positive) and `nobody` (negative).
A contradiction occurs when a later statement disagrees with an earlier one
about the same activity.

For every dialogue we iterate through the lines:

- **Statements** are parsed and stored.  When adding a statement we compare it
  with previous facts about the same activity to detect contradictions.
- **Questions** are answered using the stored facts unless a contradiction was
  detected earlier.

Three kinds of questions are supported:

1. **do/does subject predicate [object]?** – check the stored facts for that
   activity.  We answer *yes* if there is a positive statement, *no* if there is
   a negative one and *maybe* otherwise.  Pronouns `I` and `you` are swapped in
   the answer and verbs are conjugated appropriately.
2. **who predicates [object]?** – collect all subjects with a positive statement
   about the activity.  If `everybody` or `nobody` is known we answer with that
   subject, otherwise we enumerate all matching subjects in the order of their
   appearance.
3. **what do/does subject do?** – list all activities known for the subject
   (including generic ones) in the order of appearance, avoiding duplicates.
   The subject is printed once and activities are separated by commas with the
   last one preceded by `and`.

If at any time a contradiction is discovered, every further question in the
same dialogue yields the response `I am abroad.`
