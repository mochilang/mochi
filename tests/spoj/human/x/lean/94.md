# [Numeral System of the Maya](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MAYA)

## Problem Summary
Each test case describes a number written in the ancient Mayan numeral system.
A number is given as `n` followed by `n` lines representing digits from top (most significant) to bottom.
A digit uses dots (`.`) for ones and horizontal bars (`-`) for fives; segments are separated by spaces from top to bottom.
The symbol `S` denotes zero.
Digit positions use mixed base: weights are 1, 20, 360, 7200, ... (the third position is 18·20).
For every described number output its decimal value. Input ends with `n = 0`.

## Algorithm
1. Read `n`. If zero, stop. Skip blank separator lines.
2. For each of the `n` digit lines:
   - If the line is `S`, the digit value is 0.
   - Otherwise split the line by spaces. Count dots in the first non-empty part and count how many bar segments appear.
     The digit value is `dots + 5 * bars`.
3. After obtaining all digit values (in most significant first order) compute the decimal number:
   - Traverse digits from least significant to most significant while accumulating the value.
   - Use positional weights: start with `1`; the next weight is `20`, then `360` (previous·18), and every subsequent weight is previous·20.
4. Print the summed value and repeat for the next test case.

The algorithm processes each digit in O(1) time and each number in O(n) time where `n ≤ 7`.
