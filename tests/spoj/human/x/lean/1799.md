# SPOJ BOTTOM - The Bottom of a Graph

[Problem Link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/BOTTOM/)

## Algorithm

1. Build adjacency lists for the graph and its reverse from the input edges.
2. Perform a first depthâ€‘first search to obtain vertices in order of decreasing finish time.
3. Run DFS on the reversed graph following that order to assign a strongly connected component id to each vertex.
4. For each edge, mark the component of its source as having an outgoing edge if it points to a different component.
5. All vertices whose component has no outgoing edges belong to the bottom; output them in sorted order.

## Complexity

Let `v` be the number of vertices and `e` the number of edges. The algorithm runs in `O(v + e)` time and uses `O(v + e)` memory.
