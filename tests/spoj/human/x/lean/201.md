### The Game of Polygons (POLYGAME)

The triangulation of a convex polygon forms a tree where each node is a triangle and edges connect triangles sharing a side.  On each move a player removes a leaf triangle of this tree.  The first triangle given in the input is the black one; removing it wins the game.

Key observations:

1. The structure is a tree, hence removing a leaf always decreases the number of triangles by one.
2. The black triangle can be removed as soon as it becomes a leaf.  If it is already a leaf initially, the first player wins immediately.
3. When the black triangle is not a leaf, players must remove all but one of its adjacent branches before it becomes a leaf.  This requires removing all other triangles.  Since each move removes exactly one triangle, the parity of the total number of triangles determines whose turn it is when the black triangle becomes removable.
4. Thus, if the black triangle has degree greater than one, the first player wins iff the total number of triangles is even.

For each test case we count how many triangles share an edge with the black one (its degree).  The answer is:

- `YES` if the black triangle has at most one neighbour (already a leaf), or if `n` is even,
- `NO` otherwise.
