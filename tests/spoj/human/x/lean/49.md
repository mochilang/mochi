# [Hares and Foxes](https://www.spoj.com/problems/HAREFOX/)

## Problem Summary
We simulate the population changes for hares and foxes given linear recurrences

```
h_{y+1} = a·h_y - b·f_y
f_{y+1} = c·f_y + d·h_y
```

starting from an initial pair `(h_1998, f_1998)`.  For each test case we must
report the long‑term behaviour: both populations balance, both explode, one dies
out while the other overgrows, or the system behaves chaotically.

## Algorithm
1. Repeatedly update `(h, f)` using the given recurrences.
2. If both values become very small (magnitude < 1e‑7), consider the system
   balanced and stop.
3. Track the sign of each value once its magnitude exceeds 1e‑3. If a sign ever
   flips afterwards, label the system as chaotic.
4. Stop after 10 000 iterations or if either value grows beyond 1e60 and decide
   from the tracked signs:
   * `(+,+)` → Both hares and foxes will overgrow.
   * `(-,+)` → Hares will die out while foxes will overgrow.
   * `(+,-)` → Hares will overgrow while foxes will die out.
   * `(-,-)` → Both hares and foxes will die out.
   * unresolved/flip → Chaos will develop.

This brute‑force simulation mirrors the asymptotic behaviour dictated by the
transformation's eigenvalues without computing them explicitly.
