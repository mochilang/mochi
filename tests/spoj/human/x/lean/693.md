## Problem Summary
Given an integer `N` (implicit as the length of each binary index), there are `2^N` enemy ships numbered from `0` to `2^N - 1`. The bombing strategy is:
1. Bomb the first half of the ships in ascending order.
2. From the remaining half, bomb its latter half (i.e. the final quarter overall) in descending order.
3. Apply the same strategy recursively to the remaining ships (the third quarter).

For each test case, we are given the binary representation of a ship's index. We must output, in binary with the same length, the zero‑based sequence number when that ship is bombed.

## Algorithm
1. Parse the binary string `s` to obtain the ship index `x` and its length `N`.
2. Initialize `acc = 0` and `half = 2^{N-1}`.
3. Repeatedly:
   - If `N = 0`, return `acc`.
   - If `N = 1`, return `acc + x`.
   - If `x < half`, the ship lies in the first half; return `acc + x`.
   - Otherwise subtract `half` from `x` and add `half` to `acc` (first half already bombed).
   - Let `quarter = half / 2`.
   - If `x ≥ quarter` (ship in the final quarter), return `acc + (2*quarter - 1 - x)`; the order within that quarter is reversed.
   - Otherwise (ship in the third quarter), add `quarter` to `acc`, reduce `N` by `2`, set `half = quarter / 2`, and continue.
4. Convert the resulting order number to a binary string padded with leading zeros to length `N`.

The loop reduces `N` by at least two whenever recursion continues, so the algorithm runs in `O(N)` time using only basic arithmetic on big integers.
