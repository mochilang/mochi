# Johnny and the Watermelon Plantation (WMELON)

We are given up to 1000 plants in a 1000×1000 field.  Plant `i` is at
position `(xi, yi)` and bears `fi` fruits.  The task is to place an
axis‑aligned rectangle of minimal area that covers at least `k` fruits.

## Algorithm

1. **Coordinate compression.**  Collect all distinct `x` and `y` values
   of the plants and sort them.  Every plant is mapped to indices in
   these compressed arrays.
2. **Prefix by columns.**  For each compressed `x` index store the list
   of `(y_index, fruit_count)` pairs for plants with that `x`.
3. **Sweep over `x1` and `x2`.**  For each starting column `x1` keep a
   1‑D array `sums` of fruit counts over `y`.  When extending to a new
   column `x2`, update `sums` with the plants of that column.
4. **Sliding window on `y`.**  For the current `sums` find the smallest
   vertical interval with total count `≥ k` using the two‑pointer
   technique.  The area of the rectangle is `(x[x2] - x[x1]) * (y[hi] -
   y[lo])`.  Track the minimal area.

The loops iterate over all pairs of `x` columns (`≤ 1000²`) and each
iteration performs a linear scan over the compressed `y` coordinates.
This is efficient for the given constraints.

## Correctness

* The rectangle boundaries need only lie on coordinates where a plant
  exists, because moving an edge to the next plant does not decrease the
  number of covered fruits while not increasing the area.
* `sums` always contains the total fruit count of plants between `x1`
  and `x2`.  The sliding window ensures every possible `y` interval is
  examined once, hence all candidate rectangles are considered.
* The minimal area among all candidates is output, therefore the result
  is the minimal possible area covering at least `k` fruits.

## Complexity Analysis

Let `m` and `l` be the numbers of distinct `x` and `y` coordinates
(`≤ 1000`).  For every `x1` and `x2` pair we scan the `l` values once,
so the running time is `O(m² · l)`, at most about `10^9` elementary
operations in the worst case, but much smaller for typical inputs.  The
memory usage is `O(m + l + n)`.
