# CATM - The Cats and the Mouse

[Problem Link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CATM/)

The mouse moves first, followed by two cats. Each may move one square in the four cardinal directions. If the mouse reaches an edge square it can jump off the board in the next move and avoid the cats.

## Algorithm

1. For each test case, enumerate all edge squares of the \(n \times m\) grid.
2. Compute Manhattan distances from the mouse and from each cat to that edge square.
3. If the mouse's distance is **strictly** less than both cats' distances for some edge square, the mouse can reach that square before either cat and escape; otherwise it is caught.

The grid size is at most 100 Ã— 100, so enumerating all edge squares is efficient.
