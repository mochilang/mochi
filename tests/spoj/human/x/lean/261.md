# Triangle Partitioning

[Problem link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TRIPART/)

We repeatedly split a triangle by drawing the median to its longest side.
Each split produces two triangles.  When we continue this process indefinitely
only a finite number of similarity classes appears, and we must count them.

## Algorithm

- Represent a triangle by the squares of its sides.  Sort the three values in
  descending order and divide them by their greatest common divisor to obtain a
  canonical form for its similarity class.
- Perform a breadthâ€‘first exploration of all generated triangles.  For a
  triangle with squared sides `(A,B,C)` where `A` is the largest side, the
  median to side `A` has squared length `M = 2B + 2C - A`.
- The two children triangles have squared sides `(A, 4B, M)` and `(A, 4C, M)`;
  we scale by `4` to avoid fractions.  Normalize each child and enqueue it if it
  has not been seen before.
- The answer is the size of the visited set once the queue is empty.

The process terminates quickly because the number of distinct styles is less
than 100 for all inputs.
