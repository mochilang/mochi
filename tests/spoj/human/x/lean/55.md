# SPOJ JASIEK - Jasiek

The picture is a simply-connected polyomino without holes.  Jasiek gives an
anti-clockwise walk around the **centres** of its boundary squares using the
letters `N`, `E`, `S` and `W`.  Let this closed walk contain `B` moves and let
`A` be the area of the polygon obtained by connecting these centres in order.
For polyominoes the number of unit squares satisfies

```
#squares = A + B / 2 + 1
```

Hence we can accumulate twice the signed area using the shoelace formula while
traversing the moves.  The walk is anti-clockwise so the area is positive; we
still take its absolute value to be safe.  After processing all moves we output
`abs(area) / 2 + B / 2 + 1`.
