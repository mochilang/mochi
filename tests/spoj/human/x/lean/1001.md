# SPOJ BROUL - Babylonian Roulette

The table records a day's play of a roulette where each spin adjusts the pot by a multiple of the bet. Labels are -3,-2,-1,1,2,3 and each label multiplies the bet. Positive labels add money to the pot (player loses) while negative labels remove it (player wins). If a player tries to win more than remains in the pot, they take the largest multiple of the bet that does not make the pot negative. The game ends once the pot becomes smaller than the bet.

## Algorithm
1. The remainder of the pot modulo the bet never changes because each spin transfers an integer multiple of the bet. Therefore `Pf mod B` must equal `P0 mod B` or the record is invalid.
2. Let `n0 = (P0 - r) / B` and `nf = (Pf - r) / B` be the counts of full bet units, where `r = P0 mod B`.
3. If `Pf < B` then `nf = 0` and the minimal number of players is `ceil(n0 / 3)` because each spin can remove at most three units.
4. Otherwise the pot stayed at least one bet, so the difference `|nf - n0|` bet units must be covered by spins of size at most three units. The minimal number of players is `ceil(|nf - n0| / 3)`.

This yields the fewest spins required or identifies an impossible triplet.
