# SPOJ LCS2 - Longest Common Substring II

Given up to ten lowercase strings, we seek the length of the longest substring that appears in every string.

* Precompute a rolling hash base and powers.
* Build prefix hashes for each input string.
* Binary search on the candidate length `L` from `0` to the minimum string length.
* For a fixed `L`, generate hashes of all substrings of length `L` in the first string and store them in a hash set.
* For each remaining string, compute its substring hashes of length `L` and intersect them with the running set.
* If the intersection is non-empty, length `L` is achievable; adjust the binary search accordingly.

The largest achievable `L` is the answer. Hashing keeps each check nearly linear in string length, leading to an efficient solution.
