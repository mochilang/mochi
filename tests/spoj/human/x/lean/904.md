# [Image Perimeters](https://www.spoj.com/problems/IMAGE)

## Problem Summary
Given multiple rectangular grids containing '.' and 'X', a click on an 'X' selects its eight-connected component. Each grid is preceded by its dimensions and the click coordinates (1-indexed). For the selected object, compute the perimeter of its boundary. Each side of a cell that borders empty space or lies outside the grid contributes one unit to the perimeter. The input terminates with a line `0 0 0 0`.

## Algorithm
1. Read each test case until the terminating zeros. Convert the click coordinates to 0-based indices.
2. Perform a breadth-first search over the selected component using 8-direction adjacency. Maintain a visited set to avoid revisiting cells.
3. For every visited cell, inspect its four orthogonal neighbors. If a neighbor is outside the grid or contains '.', increment the perimeter count.
4. After the BFS completes, output the accumulated perimeter.

The grid size is at most 20x20, so the BFS explores at most 400 cells and runs quickly.
