# SPOJ CORNET - Corporative Network

Maintain a union–find structure where each enterprise has a parent and a
distance to that parent.  Initially every node is its own parent with
zero distance.

Operations:

* `I i j` — attach center `i` under enterprise `j`.  Set `parent[i] = j`
and `dist[i] = |i - j| mod 1000`.
* `E i` — query distance from `i` to its serving center.  Recursively
follow parents to the root while accumulating distances, applying path
compression so future queries are fast.

The `find` function returns the root of a node and updates distance to the
root during path compression.  Each query runs in nearly constant time,
so the whole input is processed efficiently even for the maximum limits.
