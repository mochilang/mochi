# SPOJ PFDEP - Project File Dependencies

We are given tasks `1..N` and `M` dependency rules of the form
`T₀ k T₁ ... T_k`, meaning task `T₀` requires tasks `T₁..T_k` to be
completed first.  We must output a permutation of `1..N` that satisfies
all dependencies, and among independent tasks choose the smallest
number first.

This is a topological ordering problem.  With `N ≤ 100`, we can use a
simple `O(N^2)` variant of Kahn's algorithm:

1. Build an adjacency list from each task to the tasks that depend on it
   and compute indegrees for each target task.
2. Repeatedly find the smallest-numbered task with indegree zero that
   has not been output yet.  Append it to the result and decrease the
   indegree of all tasks that depended on it.
3. After `N` iterations we have a valid order.

The constraints guarantee the graph is acyclic, so this process always
succeeds.
