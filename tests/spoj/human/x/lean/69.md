# MOULDS

Simulate the motion of the 1×1×30 mm blade inside the 250×250×30 block.
Maintain current position `(x, y)` and depth `z` (bottom measured from the top surface).
A hash map records, for each visited 1×1 cell, the deepest level reached.

- `^d` lowers the blade by `d` (or raises if `d` is negative).  When we descend
  and the blade is inside the block (`z < 0`), update the current cell’s depth.
- `@Dir d` shifts horizontally.  For each unit step in the chosen direction we
  move the position and, if the blade is inside the block, update that cell’s
  depth to `min(old, z)`.
- Nested command blocks are handled by recursive descent parsing.

After executing the whole block, the removed volume is the sum over all stored
cells of `-depth`.
