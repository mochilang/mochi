# SPOJ SQRBR - Square Brackets

We are given `n` and `k` along with the positions of `k` opening brackets in a
sequence of length `2n`.  The task is to count how many balanced bracket
expressions of length `2n` have opening brackets at exactly those positions.

We solve this with dynamic programming on the prefix length and the current
balance of open brackets.

Let `dp[i][b]` be the number of ways to form the first `i` characters with
`b` unmatched opening brackets.  Initially `dp[0][0] = 1`.
For each position `i` from `0` to `2n-1`:

- If position `i+1` is forced to be an opening bracket, we must increase the
  balance: `dp[i+1][b+1] += dp[i][b]`.
- Otherwise we may either place an opening bracket (increase `b`) or a closing
  bracket (decrease `b` when `b > 0`).

The answer is `dp[2n][0]`.  Because `n ≤ 19`, the state space is small and all
counts fit into standard 32‑bit integers.
