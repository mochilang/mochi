# SPOJ CONTEST - Fixed Partition Contest Management

Each problem can be solved by one of up to three team members.  The time a member
needs depends on their brightness; for each problem we know a piecewise constant
function that maps a brightness to a running time.  For every member we
precompute the time for every problem (if the member is too dull the value is
`none`).

With at most 10 problems we can simply enumerate all assignments of problems to
members.  For an assignment the jobs solved by the same member are executed in
shortest-processing-time order (SPT), which minimises the sum of completion times
for a single machine.  We sum the completion times over all members and keep the
assignment with the minimal total.

After the best assignment is found we reconstruct the exact schedule: for each
member the selected problems are sorted by processing time (breaking ties by
problem index) and we accumulate start and finish times.  The average solution
time is `total / n` formatted to two decimal places.

This exhaustive search runs in `O(3^n · n log n)` time where `n ≤ 10`.
