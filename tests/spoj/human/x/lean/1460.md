# GALAXY - A Simple Calculator in the Galaxy

The input begins with the number of test cases `T` (up to 99). Each of the following
`T` lines contains an expression `a+b`, `a-b` or `a*b` where `a` and `b` are
integers between 1 and 99.

For every line we:

1. Detect which operator is present by trying to split the string on `+`, `-`
   and `*`.
2. Convert the two resulting substrings into integers.
3. Apply the corresponding operation and print the result.

Each line is processed independently and the entire algorithm is `O(T)`.
