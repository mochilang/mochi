## Problem Summary
Given five distinct playing cards, classify the hand into one of the ten standard poker categories (royal flush, straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush, straight, three of a kind, two pairs, pair or high card).

## Algorithm
1. Parse each card into a numerical rank (2..14) and its suit.
2. Determine if all suits are identical (flush).
3. Sort ranks to check for a five‑card sequence. Handle the special case where ace acts as the lowest card (A‑2‑3‑4‑5).
4. Count occurrences of each rank using a hash map and sort the counts in descending order.
5. Use the combination of flush/straight status and rank counts to map the hand to the appropriate category, with "royal flush" being the highest straight flush (10‑A).

This procedure inspects only five cards, so it runs in constant time.
