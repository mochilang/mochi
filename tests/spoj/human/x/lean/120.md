# SOLIT - Solitaire

[Problem Link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/SOLIT/)

We are given two configurations of four indistinguishable pieces on an 8×8 board. In one
move a piece can move to an adjacent empty square or jump over a neighbouring piece
to the next square in the same direction if it is empty. We must decide whether the
second configuration is reachable from the first within eight moves.

## Algorithm

1. Encode the board state as a sorted list of four cell indices (0–63). This removes
   the permutation of pieces because they are identical.
2. Generate neighbours of a state by trying for each piece the four possible directions.
   A move is legal if the target cell is empty. If the neighbouring cell is occupied
   and the next cell in the same direction is empty and on the board, a jump is allowed.
3. Perform breadth‑first search starting from the initial state. Keep a visited set of
   encoded states and explore level by level up to depth 8.
4. If the target state appears in any level ≤ 8, answer `YES`; otherwise `NO`.

The state space within eight moves is small, so BFS is efficient for this problem.
