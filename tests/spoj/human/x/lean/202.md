# ROCKETS - Rockets

[Problem Link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/ROCKETS/)

## Algorithm

1. Pick any rocket point `r₀` from set **R**.
2. For each target point `w` in **W**, count how many remaining rockets and targets lie to the left of the directed line `r₀→w`.
3. Choose the first `w` where these two counts are equal.  The segment `r₀w` then splits the plane into two regions each containing the same number of rockets and targets.
4. Pair `r₀` with this `w`, and recursively solve the two smaller subproblems defined by the points on each side of `r₀w`.
5. The recursion stops when a single rocket and target remain.

The assumption that no three points are collinear guarantees that such a split always exists and results in non‑intersecting segments.

## Complexity

Searching for a matching `w` and partitioning the points requires `O(n^2)` work for `n` pairs.  The recursion divides the set roughly in half each time, leading to about `O(n^2 log n)` time overall and `O(n)` extra memory for the recursion stack.
