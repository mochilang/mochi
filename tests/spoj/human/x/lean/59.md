The network is a directed graph with node `1` as the server.  A computer is
**critical** if removing it makes some other computer unreachable from the
server.  We must report all such computers.

For each test case we build an adjacency list of the graph.  To determine
whether a node is critical we perform a breadth-first search from the server
while skipping the candidate node.  If the search fails to visit some other
node, the candidate is critical.  The server itself is always critical because
removing it disconnects the whole network.

The algorithm iterates through all nodes, performs the described BFS for each
(non-server) node, collects the critical ones in increasing order and outputs
their count and list.
