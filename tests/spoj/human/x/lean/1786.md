# DANGER - In Danger

[Problem Link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/DANGER/)

This is the Josephus problem with step size 2. The number of participants is
encoded as two significant digits `x` and `y` followed by `z` zeros, written as
`xy` `e` `z`. Processing ends with `00e0`.

## Algorithm
1. Convert each input line into `n = (10*x + y) * 10^z`.
2. Find the largest power of two `L ≤ n` by doubling from 1.
3. The safe position is `2*(n - L) + 1`.
4. Output the result for each case.

The doubling loop takes `O(log n)` time and is efficient for `n ≤ 99,000,000`.
