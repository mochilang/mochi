# WM06 - Soccer Choreography

This program searches for the minimal number of "dance" moves needed to transform
an initial line‑up of players into a desired formation.  A move selects a
contiguous block of players, reverses their order and flips their orientations.
This is equivalent to applying a **signed reversal** to the permutation of
players.

The solver works in three stages:

1.  **Normalisation** – The target formation is considered the identity.  Each
    player in the starting formation is replaced with the position it should
    occupy in the target, keeping a sign that indicates whether its orientation
    matches the target.  This yields a signed permutation `p` that must be
    transformed to `[1,2,…,n]`.
2.  **IDA\*** – The search for an optimal sequence of reversals uses iterative
    deepening A*.  The heuristic is the number of *breakpoints* in `p` divided by
    two.  A breakpoint is a pair of adjacent numbers that are not consecutive.
    Every reversal decreases the breakpoint count, so the heuristic is
    admissible and guarantees optimality.
3.  **Reconstruction** – The list of reversals returned by IDA\* is applied to
    the original starting formation, producing the sequence of intermediate
    states that is printed by the program.

The input may contain multiple test cases terminated by a line containing `0`.
For each case the program prints the minimal number of moves followed by the
initial formation and the state after each move, using `+` to denote players
facing the correct direction.
