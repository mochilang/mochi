# SPOJ EQDIV - Equidivisions

[Problem Link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/EQDIV/)

We build an \(n \times n\) grid and label cells with their region id. The input
provides coordinates for the first \(n-1\) regions; the remaining cells belong to
the \(n\)-th region.

For each region we run a floodâ€‘fill (DFS) using 4-directional moves to count the
reachable cells. If the number of visited cells equals the number of cells of
the region, the region is contiguous. All regions must be contiguous for the
partition to be `good`.

The complexity per test case is \(O(n^2)\) with \(n < 100\).
