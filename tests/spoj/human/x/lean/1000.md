# EQDIV - Equidivisions

Given an `n×n` grid, each of the `n` regions must contain exactly `n` cells. The input lists the coordinates for the first `n−1` regions and the remaining cells form the last region. A region is *good* when all of its cells form a single 4‑connected component.

Algorithm:

1. Build a grid of size `n*n` and mark cells for the first `n−1` regions using the provided coordinates. Unmarked cells belong to the `n`‑th region.
2. For each region `k` from `1` to `n`, run a BFS restricted to cells labelled `k`.
   - Start from any cell of the region and explore using 4‑directional neighbours.
   - Count how many cells are reached.
3. Compare the BFS count with the number of cells labelled `k`. If they differ, the region is disconnected and the equidivision is `wrong`.
4. If all regions are connected, print `good`; otherwise `wrong`.

The BFS uses a queue implemented as a list and a hash set for visited indices. The overall complexity is `O(n^2)` per test case since each cell is visited once for its region.
