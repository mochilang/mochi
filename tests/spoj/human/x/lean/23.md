## Problem Summary
Given the six edge lengths of a tetrahedron for multiple test cases, compute its volume. Each test provides the edges in the
order AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD and the answer must be printed with four digits after the decimal point.

## Algorithm
To compute the volume from the edges we use a closed-form expression derived from the Cayleyâ€“Menger determinant.  Let
```
W = AB, V = AC, u = AD,
U = BC, v = BD, w = CD
```
For these variables define
```
U2 = U^2, V2 = V^2, W2 = W^2
u2 = u^2, v2 = v^2, w2 = w^2
u1 = v2 + w2 - U2
v1 = w2 + u2 - V2
w1 = u2 + v2 - W2
```
Then the volume is
```
sqrt(4*u2*v2*w2 - u2*u1^2 - v2*v1^2 - w2*w1^2 + u1*v1*w1) / 12
```
The expression under the square root is clamped at zero to avoid negative values due to floating point errors.  Each test line is
parsed, the volume is computed, and the result is formatted to four decimal places.
