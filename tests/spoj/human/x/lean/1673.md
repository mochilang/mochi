# [Ambitious Manager](https://www.spoj.com/problems/AMBM)

## Problem Summary
Given a period of `K` days, each day originally pays `a_i` rupees. The manager
redefines the salary for day `i` as

`b_i = a_i + 2*a_{i-1} + 2^2*a_{i-2} + ... + 2^{i-1}*a_1`.

For each test case we are given the target amount `N` and the list of `a_i`.
We must determine whether there exists a subset of days such that the sum of
their redefined salaries equals exactly `N`, and output the 1‑based indices of
any such subset in increasing order. If no subset yields `N`, output `-1`.

## Algorithm
1. Compute the adjusted salaries `b_i` iteratively using `b_i = a_i + 2 * b_{i-1}`.
2. Split the array `b` into two halves.
3. Enumerate all subset sums of the first half and store them in a hash map
   from sum to the corresponding bitmask.
4. Recursively explore subsets of the second half. For each partial sum,
   look up the required complement in the map. If found, combine the two
   masks to obtain the chosen day indices.
5. Output the indices separated by spaces, or `-1` if no subset matches `N`.

This meet‑in‑the‑middle approach runs in `O(2^{K/2})` time and uses similar
memory.
