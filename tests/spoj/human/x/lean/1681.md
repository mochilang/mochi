## Problem Summary
We have a rectangular sheet with width `w` and height `h` (`w \le h`).
The sheet is cut horizontally into two parts. From the first part a circle of
maximum possible radius is cut out as the base of a cylinder. The second part
is rolled to form the lateral surface so that its perimeter equals the
circumference of the base. Determine the maximum volume of a cylinder that can
be obtained.

## Algorithm
1. Let `r` be the base radius. Cutting the circle consumes height `2r`, leaving
a rectangle `w × (h-2r)` for the side surface.
2. Two orientations are possible when rolling the remaining rectangle:
   - **Case A:** use its height `h-2r` as the perimeter and `w` as the cylinder
     height. Feasible for `2πr ≤ h-2r`. The volume is `π r² w`, maximized at
     `r = min(w/2, h/(2(π+1)))`.
   - **Case B:** use width `w` as the perimeter and `h-2r` as the cylinder
     height. Feasible for `2πr ≤ w`. The volume is `π r² (h-2r)` with optimum
     `r = min(h/3, w/(2π))`.
3. Compute both candidate volumes and output the larger one, rounded to three
   decimals.

The computation is constant time per test case.
