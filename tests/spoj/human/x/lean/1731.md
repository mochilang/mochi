# SPOJ TCOUNT3 - Counting Triangles III

We arrange a level `n` hexagram by placing two equilateral triangles of side `3n`
pointing in opposite directions.  Each big triangle contains the number of
sub‑triangles given in the classic `TRICOUNT` problem.  The overlap of the two
triangles is a regular hexagon of side `n` whose triangle count is the same as in
`TCOUNT2`.

Let

- `tri(m) = floor(m(m+2)(2m+1) / 8)` – triangles inside a triangle of side `m`.
- `hex(n) = n(5n+1)(n+1)/2` – triangles inside a hexagon of side `n`.

The hexagram consists of both big triangles minus the duplicated hexagon
portion, so the total number of triangles is

```
S(n) = 2 * tri(3n) - hex(n)
```

This simplifies to the closed form

```
S(n) = (44 n^3 + 33 n^2 + 4 n - (n mod 2)) / 4
```

which fits in 64‑bit signed integers for all valid `n`.
