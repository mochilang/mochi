# [The Shortest Path](https://www.spoj.com/problems/SHPATH/)

## Problem Summary
For each test case a set of cities with positive-cost connections is given. For several queries we must output the minimum transportation cost between two named cities.

## Algorithm
1. Read all cities, storing their adjacency lists and mapping their names to indices.
2. For each query, run Dijkstra's algorithm from the source index. Distances are stored in an array and the next node is selected by scanning for the smallest unvisited distance.
3. Relax edges of the chosen node and continue until the destination is reached.
4. Print the resulting minimum cost for each query.

This implementation uses only basic arrays and loops, which is adequate for the provided test data.
