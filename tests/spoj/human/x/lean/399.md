# TRANK - Team Rankings

We receive up to 100 rankings of the teams A–E.  The distance between two rankings is the number of unordered pairs of teams that appear in a different relative order.  The goal is to find a ranking whose total distance to all given rankings is minimal (ties broken lexicographically).

With only five teams there are only `5! = 120` possible rankings.  For each candidate ranking we convert it and every vote into an array mapping team to its position.  The distance between two arrays is computed by checking all ten pairs of teams and counting disagreements.  The candidate with the smallest total distance is reported, choosing the lexicographically smallest string when multiple candidates share the same value.

This brute‑force approach is fast because the number of permutations is tiny.
