# Intergalactic Map

[Problem link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/IM/)

We must determine whether there exists a simple path from planet 1 to
planet 3 that visits planet 2 somewhere in the middle without repeating
any planet.  The graph is undirected and up to 30k vertices and 50k
edges.

## Algorithm

- Build an adjacency list for the graph.
- Perform a breadthâ€‘first search starting from planet 2.  Each neighbor
  of planet 2 receives a unique "color" equal to its index, and this
  color is propagated to all vertices reached from that neighbor.
- If planets 1 and 3 are reachable with different colors, the paths from
  planet 2 to planets 1 and 3 start with different neighbors of 2 and
  therefore share no vertices other than planet 2.
- Output `YES` if such colors exist; otherwise output `NO`.

The BFS runs in O(n + m) time.
