# MONODIG - Monodigital Representations

The task asks for the minimal number of occurrences of a digit `K` needed to build a given integer using only
`K` and the operations `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and parenthesis.  Division is allowed only when it divides evenly.
We must answer for several queries and lengths beyond `8` are ignored.

## Algorithm

For a fixed digit `K` we precompute all values that can be formed using at most eight copies of `K`.
For length `ℓ (1 ≤ ℓ ≤ 8)` we maintain a set of numbers obtainable with exactly `ℓ` digits.
The initial element for each `ℓ` is the number consisting of `ℓ` copies of `K` (e.g. `55` for `ℓ=2`).

For every pair of lengths `i + j = ℓ` and for every numbers `x` in set `i` and `y` in set `j`
we generate new values using all allowed operations:

* `x + y`
* `|x - y|`
* `x * y`
* `x / y` and `y / x` when divisible.

Whenever a new value `v` (between `1` and `32000`) is produced for the first time
we record its minimal length `ℓ` and insert it into set `ℓ` for future combinations.

After filling all lengths up to `8`, answering a query `a` is simply looking up the
precomputed minimal length.  If the entry is missing we output `NO`.

The limits (`ℓ ≤ 8`, `a ≤ 32000`) keep the state space small enough for the exhaustive combination.
