# PARTIT - Partition

We must output the k-th nondecreasing sequence of n positive integers whose sum is m.

`count(m, n, min)` returns the number of such sequences with first element at least
`min`.  It is computed with memoized recursion:

* If `n = 0`, the only valid sequence is the empty one when `m = 0`.
* Otherwise the first element can be any `a` between `min` and `m / n`.
  For each candidate `a` we add `count(m - a, n - 1, a)`.

To construct the k-th partition we iterate over possible first elements `a` in
increasing order and subtract the counts until the correct block is found.  We then
recurse with `(m - a, n - 1, a)` and the adjusted index.  This yields the desired
sequence in lexicographic order.
