# DIV - Divisors

[Problem Link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/DIV/)

We must find all positive integers \(N \le 10^6\) such that the number of divisors of \(N\), denoted \(d(N)\), is a product of two **distinct** primes \(p\) and \(q\). The result requires printing only every 9‑th such number.

## Algorithm

1. **Divisor counts:** Use a sieve. Start with an array of zeros of size \(10^6+1\). For each \(i\) from 1 to \(10^6\) increment every multiple of \(i\). After the loops `cnts[n]` equals \(d(n)\).
2. **Semiprime check:** For each number's divisor count \(d\), factor \(d\) by trial division starting from 2. Keep at most two distinct prime factors and ensure each appears only once. The count is accepted only if we end with exactly two different primes.
3. **Collect results:** Iterate through all \(n\). When \(d(n)\) passes the semiprime check, append \(n\) to a list.
4. **Output:** Print every 9‑th element of this list (the 9th, 18th, ... positions).

The sieve runs in \(O(n \log n)\) time and factoring the small values of \(d(n)\) is constant time, so the entire procedure comfortably fits within the limits.
