## Problem Summary
Read a single line of up to 1000 uppercase letters and output the same letters sorted in non-decreasing alphabetical order.

## Algorithm
1. Read the line and remove the trailing newline.
2. Convert the string into an array of characters.
3. Sort the array using `qsort` with the comparator `(· ≤ ·)`.
4. Build a new string from the sorted characters and print it.

The sorting step dominates the running time at `O(n log n)` for `n` letters and uses `O(n)` extra memory.
