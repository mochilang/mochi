# [Printer Queue](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PQUEUE/)

## Problem Summary
Given `n` print jobs with priorities `1` to `9` and your job at position `m`, the printer repeatedly takes the first job. If any remaining job has higher priority, the taken job is moved to the end; otherwise it is printed. Each job takes one minute to print. Determine how many minutes until your job is printed.

## Algorithm
1. Represent the queue as a list of pairs `(index, priority)`.
2. Repeatedly remove the first job `(i, p)`.
   - If any job in the remaining list has priority greater than `p`, append `(i, p)` to the end of the list.
   - Otherwise increment the elapsed time and, if `i = m`, return this time; otherwise continue with the rest of the list.
3. Output the time once your job is printed.

The queue length is at most 100, so this direct simulation runs comfortably within the limits.
