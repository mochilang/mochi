# SPOJ SUDOKU2 - Sudoku

The program checks whether an unsolved Sudoku puzzle can be obtained from a
solved board using valid Sudoku transformations.

## Algorithm

1. **Read input**: For each test case read the solved board and the unsolved
   puzzle as 9×9 grids of digits.
2. **Enumerate transformations**:
   - Four rotations of the board (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°).
   - Permute row segments, rows within each segment, column segments and
     columns within each segment. Each of these uses the 6 permutations of three
     elements. The total number of row permutations is `3! * (3!)^3` and the same
     for columns.
3. **Check digit mapping**: For each transformed board compare all fixed cells of
   the unsolved puzzle. Maintain a mapping of digits from the transformed solved
   board to the puzzle digits. The mapping must be a permutation—two digits cannot
   map to the same digit.
4. **Result**: If any combination yields a consistent mapping, output `Yes`,
   otherwise `No`.

The enumeration is feasible because of the small constant size. Unknown cells
(zeros) in the puzzle are ignored during comparison.
