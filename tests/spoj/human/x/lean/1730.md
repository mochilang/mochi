# TCOUNT2 - Counting Triangles II

[Problem link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TCOUNT2/)

## Algorithm

A level `N` hexagon is formed by gluing six level `N` triangles on a
triangular grid.  Counting all distinct equilateral triangles inside this
shape gives a cubic expression with a parity adjustment:

```
T(N) = (14*N^3 + 9*N^2 + 2*N - (N mod 2)) / 4
```

We simply evaluate this formula for each test case using integer arithmetic.

## Complexity

Each test case requires a constant amount of work, so the time complexity is
`O(1)` with `O(1)` extra memory.
