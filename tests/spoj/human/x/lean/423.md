# ASSIGN - Assignments

We are given a bipartite graph between `n` students and `n` topics.  The
matrix has `1` at `(i,j)` if student `i` likes topic `j`.  We must count the
number of perfect matchings where each student receives exactly one topic they
like.

With `n ≤ 20` we can use dynamic programming over bitmasks.  For a mask of
already used topics we know how many students are assigned: `i` is the number of
set bits.  We recursively try all topics liked by student `i` that are not set
in the mask and memoise the result for each mask.

The state space is `2^n` and each transition examines at most `n` topics, so the
complexity is `O(n·2^n)` which fits easily for the given limits.

The sample tests from the statement are included as golden tests.
