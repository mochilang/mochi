# TRICOUNT - Counting Triangles

Given a triangular grid of level `N`, formed by dividing each side of an
equilateral triangle into `N` segments and drawing parallels, we must count all
triangles contained in it.

## Algorithm

For a fixed `N` the number of triangles (of all sizes and orientations) has a
closed form.  Let

```
S(N) = N * (N + 2) * (2*N + 1)
```

If `N` is even the total number of triangles is `S(N) / 8`.  When `N` is odd,
`S(N)` is 1 more than a multiple of 8 so the count is `(S(N) - 1) / 8`.  Thus
for any `N` we can compute

```
if N % 2 == 0:
    result = N*(N+2)*(2*N+1)/8
else:
    result = (N*(N+2)*(2*N+1)-1)/8
```

## Correctness

Every upright triangle of side `k` appears `(N - k + 1)*(N - k + 2)/2` times;
counting over all `k` and adding the number of inverted triangles yields the
above closed form.  The formula evaluates exactly to the total number of
triangles, so the algorithm outputs the correct count for each test case.

## Complexity

The computation is constant time and uses only integer arithmetic.  The program
runs in `O(T)` time for `T` test cases.
