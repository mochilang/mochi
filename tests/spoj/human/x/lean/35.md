# [Equipment Box](https://www.spoj.com/problems/EQBOX/)

## Problem Summary
Given tile dimensions `A` and `B` and box dimensions `X` and `Y`, determine if the box can be placed entirely within one tile without touching the tile's border. The box may be rotated. Output the appropriate message for each test case.

## Algorithm
1. Read integers `A`, `B`, `X`, `Y` for each test case.
2. Check two orientations: `(X < A && Y < B)` and `(X < B && Y < A)`.
3. If either orientation fits strictly inside the tile, print `"Escape is possible."`; otherwise print `"Box cannot be dropped."`.

The check is constant time per test case, so the overall complexity is O(T).
