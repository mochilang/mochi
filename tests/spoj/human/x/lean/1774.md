# ALL - All Discs Considered

We are given two DVDs containing packages labelled `1..N1` and `N1+1..N1+N2`.
Some packages depend on others, forming a DAG.  When installing packages with a
single drive we want to minimize the number of times we change DVDs.  The initial
insertion and the final removal of a disc each count as a change.

The key observation is that when a disc is inserted we should process *all*
currently installable packages from that disc before switching: leaving a
DVD early can only increase the number of changes.

The algorithm therefore simulates the installation using a variant of
topological sorting:

1. Build adjacency lists and indegrees for the dependency graph.
2. Maintain two queues of packages with zero indegree, one for each DVD.
3. Start with either DVD (both possibilities are tried) and repeatedly
   process the queue of the current disc.  When it becomes empty and the
   other queue is non‑empty, switch discs and increment the switch counter.
4. After all packages are installed, the minimal number of disc changes is
   `switches + 2` to account for the initial insertion and final removal.

We simulate starting with DVD 1 and DVD 2 and take the smaller result.
The sample tests from the problem statement serve as golden tests.
