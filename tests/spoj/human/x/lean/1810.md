# SPOJ ORZ - Nuclear Plants

The plain is an `n × m` rectangle. Around each small plant we exclude a circle
of radius `0.58`, and around each large plant a circle of radius `1.31`. The
usable area equals the rectangle's area minus the union of all these discs
clipped to the rectangle.

For a fixed vertical line at coordinate `x` we can determine the forbidden
segments along the `y` axis: each circle intersecting the line contributes an
interval `[cy - √(r² - (x - cx)²), cy + √(r² - (x - cx)²)]`, clipped to
`[0, m]`. Merging the intervals yields the total forbidden length `g(x)`.

We integrate `g(x)` across the range of `x` that covers all circles using
adaptive Simpson integration. This provides the total area covered by the
circles (to within `10⁻²`). Finally we output `n * m - area` rounded to two
decimal places.

The integration evaluates the coverage function only where needed, giving a
complexity of `O(k log k * E)`, where `k ≤ 200` is the number of plants and `E`
is the number of evaluations required by Simpson's method.
