# TAUT - Tautology

The input is a set of propositional formulas written in prefix notation.  Operators:

- `C` — conjunction
- `D` — disjunction
- `I` — implication
- `E` — equivalence
- `N` — negation

Variables are lowercase letters.  To decide whether an expression is a tautology we:

1. Parse the prefix string into a syntax tree using simple recursion: consume a
   character and recursively parse its operands depending on the operator.
2. Collect the distinct variables appearing in the expression.  With at most
   16 variables there are at most \(2^{16}\) possible assignments.
3. Enumerate all assignments using bitmasks and evaluate the expression for
   each assignment.  Evaluation is standard Boolean logic.
4. If the expression evaluates to true for every assignment we print `YES`; otherwise `NO`.

The sample tests from the problem statement are used as a golden test.
