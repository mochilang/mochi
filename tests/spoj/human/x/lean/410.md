# VHUFFM - Variable Radix Huffman Encoding

Given frequencies for the first `N` letters `A..`, build a Huffman code using
an `R`-ary alphabet of digits `0..R-1`.  If `(N-1)` is not divisible by `R-1`
we append fictitious zero-frequency symbols so that the Huffman tree can be
constructed.

At each step the `R` lowest-frequency symbols are combined into a new node.  If
frequencies tie, the node whose earliest original letter is earlier in the
alphabet is chosen first.  The children are ordered by increasing frequency and
assigned digits `0..R-1`.  After repeatedly combining nodes a single tree
remains.  Walking the tree from the root to each original leaf yields its code.

The average length is computed as `sum(freq_i * |code_i|) / sum(freq_i)` and the
result is rounded to two decimals.

The algorithm sorts the small list of nodes in every step, giving `O(n log n)`
complexity for `n â‰¤ 35` nodes.
