# SPOJ EOWAMRT - Earth Observation with a Mobile Robot Team

This program simulates how information propagates among mobile robots.
Each robot follows a piecewise linear trajectory given by time points
and velocities. When two robots are within distance `R` they share all
information instantaneously.

## Algorithm

1. **Parse input**: for every dataset read the robots' trajectories and
   convert them into segments with constant velocities.
2. **Compute contact intervals**: for every pair of robots, intersect
their segments. For each overlap solve a quadratic inequality to find
the time interval when the distance between the robots is at most `R`.
3. **Temporal graph propagation**: treat each contact interval as an edge
available only within its time window. Using a Dijkstra-like search we
propagate the time when each robot first receives the data from the
initial robot.
4. **Output**: all robots whose reception time is within `T` are printed
in lexicographic order.

The complexity is `O(N^2 * S)` where `S` is the number of segments per
robot (â‰¤ 100 for the constraints), which is easily fast enough.
