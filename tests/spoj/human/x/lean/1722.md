# SPOJ RP - Life, the Universe, and Everything II

We are given integers `k` and `n` and consider the graph on vertices `1..n` where
an undirected edge connects `i` and `j` whenever `0 < |i-j| ≤ k`.
All edges have the same weight, so any spanning tree is a minimum spanning tree.
Our task is therefore to count the number of spanning trees of this graph modulo
65521.

By Kirchhoff's Matrix-Tree theorem the number of spanning trees equals the
determinant of any cofactor of the graph's Laplacian matrix.  For `n` vertices we
construct the Laplacian `L` by setting `L[i][i]` to the degree of vertex `i` and
`L[i][j] = -1` when vertices `i` and `j` are adjacent.  Removing the last row and
column yields an `(n-1)×(n-1)` matrix `M` whose determinant is the desired count.

The program explicitly builds this matrix and computes its determinant using
Gaussian elimination over the rationals.  The result is finally reduced modulo
65521.

The complexity is `O(n^3)`, which is acceptable for the small inputs used in the
tests.
