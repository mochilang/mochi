# FRACTION - Sort fractions

We are asked to list all reduced fractions \(x/y\) with \(0 \le x/y \le 1\) and \(y \le N\), sorted in ascending order (the Farey sequence of order \(N\)). For each query we must report the \(i\)-th fraction in this sequence.

## Algorithm
1. Read all query indices for a test case and find the maximum requested index.
2. Generate the Farey sequence of order \(N\) using the neighbor formula. Starting with \(0/1\) and \(1/N\), the next term \(e/f\) after \(a/b\) and \(c/d\) is computed by
   \[k = \lfloor (N + b)/d \rfloor, \quad e = k c - a, \quad f = k d - b.\]
   Append each term to a list until either \(1/1\) is reached or enough terms are produced for the largest query.
3. For each query index \(i\) (1-based) output the stored fraction at position \(i\).

This approach generates only as many terms as needed (at most 10â€¯000) and answers each query in constant time.
