# HISTOGRA - Largest Rectangle in a Histogram

We are given several histograms. Each histogram is described by the number of bars `n`
followed by the heights of the `n` bars. The task is to compute the maximum area of a
rectangle aligned with the base line that can be formed using contiguous bars.

## Algorithm

We process the bars from left to right maintaining a stack of indices of bars with
non-decreasing heights. For each position `i` with height `h[i]`:

1. While the stack is non-empty and `h[i]` is less than the height at the top of the
   stack, we pop the top index `t`. The rectangle with height `h[t]` extends from the
   index after the new top of the stack (or 0 if the stack is empty) up to `i - 1`.
   We compute its area and keep the maximum.
2. Push `i` onto the stack.

After all bars are processed, we pop the remaining indices and compute areas as if the
right boundary were at `n`.

This algorithm runs in `O(n)` time for each histogram and requires `O(n)` space for the
stack.
