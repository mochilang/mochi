# [Cable TV Network](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CABLETV/)

## Problem Summary
Given a cable network with `n` relays and `m` bidirectional cables, compute the *safety factor*:
- `n` if the network stays connected no matter how many relays are removed (complete graph).
- Otherwise, the smallest number of relays whose removal disconnects the network.
An empty network or a single relay is considered connected. Input contains up to 20 test cases with `n ≤ 50`.

## Algorithm
1. Build an `n × n` adjacency matrix from the list of cables.
2. If the graph is disconnected (BFS from any node fails to visit all vertices), the answer is `0`.
3. If every pair of vertices is connected, return `n`.
4. Otherwise, for every ordered pair of distinct vertices `(s, t)`:
   - Split each vertex `v` into `v_in` and `v_out` with an edge of capacity `1` between them (capacity `n` for `s` and `t`).
   - For every original edge `(u, v)` add edges `u_out → v_in` and `v_out → u_in` with infinite capacity.
   - Run Edmonds–Karp max flow from `s_out` to `t_in`. The resulting flow is the minimum vertex cut separating `s` and `t`.
   - Keep the smallest cut value over all pairs.
5. Output this minimum as the safety factor.

## Complexity
With `n ≤ 50`, the constructed flow network has `2n` nodes. Edmonds–Karp runs in `O(VE^2)` and we run it for `O(n^2)` pairs, leading to `O(n^4)` time in the worst case, which is feasible for the given limits.
