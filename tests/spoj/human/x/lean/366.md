Given counts of cypress trees in fields (cycles) and strips (lines), the son may select exactly `Q` cypress trees. Choosing a whole field yields `Ni` olives for `Ni` cypress. Any partial selection—either from a strip or part of a field—forms a single segment of length `L` producing `L - 1` olives.

Thus the total number of olives equals `Q` minus the number of such segments. To maximize olives, minimize segments:

1. Sort field sizes in descending order and take whole fields while `Q` allows.
2. Collect the sizes of remaining fields and all strips as available segment lengths.
3. Sort these lengths descending and greedily use the largest ones until the remaining cypress count is covered. The number of lengths used is the segment count.
4. Answer is `Q - segments`.

This runs in `O((M + K) log(M + K))` per test case.
