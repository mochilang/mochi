# IMPORT - Galactic Import

## Algorithm
1. For each galaxy read the list of planets.  Each planet is given by its
   label, the value of its export and a string of connections.
   * The string may contain `*` meaning a direct connection to Earth.
   * Other letters denote undirected hyperspace lines between planets.
2. Build an undirected graph on at most 26 vertices (A–Z) and mark the
   planets that have a `*`.
3. Run a multi–source BFS starting from all starred planets.  The distance
   of a planet is the number of edges to the nearest planet with a star.
4. The effective value of a planet is
   `value * (0.95 ^ distance)`, because every intermediate planet keeps 5%
   of a shipment.
5. Choose the planet with maximal effective value.  Ties are resolved by
   picking the alphabetically earliest label.
6. Output `"Import from X"` for that planet.

## Correctness
- Any path from a planet to Earth must pass through a starred planet.  The
  distance computed by BFS is the minimum number of shipping lines needed to
  reach Earth, minus one for the final leg.  Therefore the factor
  `0.95^distance` matches the cumulative loss on the best route.
- BFS ensures that the found distance is minimal, hence no other route can
  yield a higher effective value for the same planet.
- By considering all planets and selecting the one with the highest
  effective value, the algorithm outputs exactly the planet with the most
  profitable import for HyperCommodities.  Alphabetical tie breaking is done
  explicitly.

## Complexity
Let `P ≤ 26` be the number of planets in a galaxy and `L` the number of
shipping lines.  Building the graph and running BFS both take `O(P + L)`
operations.  All operations use constant memory for 26 planets.
