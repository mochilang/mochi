# ACMAKER - ACM (ACronymMaker)

We are given an abbreviation and a phrase. After removing all insignificant words, each remaining word
must contribute at least one letter to the abbreviation. Letters of the abbreviation must appear in order
within the significant words.

## Algorithm

1. Read the list of insignificant words into a hash set for quick lookup.
2. For each test case:
   - Split the line into the abbreviation and phrase words.
   - Discard insignificant words and collect the significant ones.
   - Convert the abbreviation to lowercase to match the lowercase phrase.
   - For each significant word compute, for every start index `s` in the abbreviation,
     how many ways a substring `abbr[s:end]` can appear as a subsequence of the word.
     This is done with a simple subsequence DP in `O(len(word) * len(abbr))`.
   - Use another DP across the words. `ways[i]` stores the number of ways to form the
     first `i` letters of the abbreviation using the words processed so far.
     For each word we update `ways` using the precomputed substring counts, ensuring that
     at least one letter is taken from each word.
3. The answer is `ways[k]` where `k` is the length of the abbreviation. If it is zero, the
   abbreviation is not valid.

The sizes are small (phrase length â‰¤ 150), so this DP is easily fast enough.
