## Problem Summary
Given an expression of single-digit numbers combined with `+` and `*`, we may insert parentheses arbitrarily. We must compute the maximum value Lisa can obtain and the minimum value her father can obtain.

## Algorithm
1. Parse the expression into an array of numbers and an array of operators.
2. Use dynamic programming on subexpressions. For every interval `[i, j]` of numbers, store the maximal and minimal results obtainable.
3. Initialize `dpMax[i][i]` and `dpMin[i][i]` to the value of the `i`-th number.
4. Increase the length of the interval from `2` to `n`, and for each partition `k` between `i` and `j`:
   - If the operator is `+`, combine by addition; if `*`, combine by multiplication.
   - Update the best maximum and minimum for `[i, j]`.
5. The values for the full interval give the desired maximum and minimum.

This runs in `O(n^3)` time with `n` being the number of digits (at most 50).
