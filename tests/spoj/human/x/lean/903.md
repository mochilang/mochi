# Double Vision

[Problem link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/DOUBLEVI/)

We are given `n` font symbols, each drawn on an `r × c` grid using `o` for ink
and `.` for blank cells.  We must determine whether every symbol can be
identified by examining at most two of its ink pixels.  A chosen set of pixels
identifies a symbol if no other symbol has ink in all of those positions.  When
such pixels exist we replace them with `#` in the output; otherwise the test
case is reported as impossible.

## Algorithm

1. Convert each symbol into a boolean array over the `r × c` grid.  For every
   coordinate count how many symbols contain an ink pixel there.
2. For each symbol in order:
   * Scan all its pixels in row-major order.  If the symbol has ink at a
     coordinate whose global count is one, that single pixel uniquely identifies
     the symbol.
   * Otherwise enumerate all pairs of its ink pixels in row-major order.
     A pair is valid if no other symbol has ink in both positions.  The first
     valid pair according to this order is selected.
   * If neither a single pixel nor a pair works, the font is impossible.
3. Replace the selected pixel(s) with `#` and print the modified grids.

The grid has at most `10 × 10 = 100` positions, so checking all pixel pairs for
a symbol is efficient.  The overall complexity is `O(n * (r*c)^2)`, well within
limits.
