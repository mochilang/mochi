# Solution for NOCHANGE

Given coin values `v1..vk` with unlimited counts but subject to `c1 >= c2 >= ... >= ck`,
let `d_i = c_i - c_{i+1}` for `i < k` and `d_k = c_k`. Then
`c_i = d_i + ... + d_k` and the total amount becomes

```
x = Σ_{i=1..k} c_i * v_i = Σ_{i=1..k} d_i * (v_1 + v_2 + ... + v_i)
```

Therefore the problem reduces to checking if `x` can be expressed as a non‑negative
combination of the prefix sums `w_i = v_1 + ... + v_i`.
We solve this unbounded subset-sum using dynamic programming:

1. Build an array `dp[0..x]` with `dp[0] = true`.
2. For each prefix weight `w_i` and for each amount `a` from `w_i` to `x`, set
   `dp[a] |= dp[a - w_i]`.
3. Output `YES` iff `dp[x]` is true.

This runs in `O(k*x)` time (≤ 5·100000 operations) and `O(x)` memory.
