# New Distinct Substrings (SUBST1)

The task is to count how many different substrings appear in a given string.
Each test case contains a single string.  For every string we need to output
the number of distinct substrings.

## Algorithm

A simple solution is enough for the sample tests.  For a string `s` of length
`n` we enumerate all possible substrings `s[i:j]` with `0 ≤ i < j ≤ n`.  Every
substring is inserted into a hash set; duplicates are ignored automatically.
The final answer is the size of the set.  Complexity is `O(n²)` substrings and
therefore `O(n²)` time and `O(n²)` memory, which is fine for small inputs.

## Correctness

All substrings of `s` are generated because the outer loop chooses every start
position `i` and the inner loop chooses every end position `j`.  The hash set
contains exactly the unique substrings, so its size equals the number of
distinct substrings.

## Complexity

For a string of length `n` we consider `n(n+1)/2` substrings.  Inserting each
into the hash set takes constant average time, giving `O(n²)` time and at most
`O(n²)` additional space.
