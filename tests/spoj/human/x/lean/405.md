# [Tin Cutter](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TCUTTER)

## Problem Summary
Given a sequence of horizontal and vertical segment cuts on a tin plate, determine how many holes are formed after all cuts. The input contains multiple test cases ending with `0`. Each test case starts with the number of cuts followed by their endpoints.

## Algorithm
1. For every pair of segments compute intersection points (only vertical with horizontal).
2. For each segment collect its endpoints and all intersections, sort them along the segment and connect consecutive points to form edges.
3. Build an adjacency map of points and count total edges and vertices.
4. Use DFS to count connected components of the graph.
5. Apply Euler's formula for planar graphs: `holes = edges - vertices + components`.

This approach handles up to 100 cuts comfortably and runs in `O(N^2)` time for intersection detection.
