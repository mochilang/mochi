## Problem Summary
Given an integer `n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20000)`, find the smallest positive multiple of `n` whose decimal representation consists only of digits 0 and 1 and begins with 1.

## Algorithm
1. Perform a breadth-first search over numbers composed of digits 0 and 1 without constructing large integers. Each state stores the string representation and its remainder modulo `n`.
2. Initialize the queue with "1" and remainder `1 mod n`. Maintain a set of visited remainders to avoid repetition.
3. Pop from the queue; if the remainder is zero, the corresponding string is the answer.
4. Otherwise append digits `0` and `1` to the string. For each extension compute the new remainder `(r*10)%n` or `(r*10+1)%n` and enqueue it if that remainder has not been seen.

The search explores remainders in increasing string length, ensuring the first time remainder `0` is reached we have the minimal-length multiple. The number of remainders is bounded by `n`, yielding `O(n)` time and space.
