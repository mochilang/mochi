# [Fast Multiplication Again](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MULTIPLY/)

## Problem Summary
Given two positive integers, each on its own line, compute and output their product. The result is guaranteed to be less than 10000.

## Algorithm
1. Read the first line and parse it as an integer `a`.
2. Read the second line and parse it as an integer `b`.
3. Compute `a * b` and print the result.

## Correctness Proof
- Step 1 obtains the value of the first input integer `a`.
- Step 2 obtains the value of the second input integer `b`.
- Step 3 multiplies `a` and `b` using exact integer arithmetic and outputs the product. Since the problem guarantees the true result fits in standard integer types, this output is correct.

Therefore, the program outputs exactly the product of the two given integers.

## Complexity Analysis
Let the numbers have up to `d` digits. Parsing each number and performing the multiplication take `O(d)` time. Memory usage is `O(1)`.
