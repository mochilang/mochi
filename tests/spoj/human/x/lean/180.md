# [How to pack containers](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CONTPACK/)

## Problem Summary
Given boxes and containers where each height is a power of two (expressed as its exponent), determine whether all containers can be tightly packed using the boxes from the warehouse. If possible, compute the minimal total value of goods placed into the containers. Each container must be packed exactly and boxes cannot be split.

## Algorithm
1. Parse box descriptions and group their values by size exponent.
2. Parse container descriptions to know how many containers of each size are required.
3. Iterate over size exponents from smallest to largest:
   - Merge boxes of the current size with leftover boxes from smaller sizes and sort by value.
   - If there are fewer boxes than containers of this size, packing is impossible.
   - Take the cheapest needed boxes and add their values to the total cost.
   - Pair remaining boxes (from smallest values) to form boxes of the next size by summing each pair's values.
4. If all sizes are processed without shortage, output the accumulated cost; otherwise print `No`.

The iteration runs through at most the maximum size (â‰¤1000) and manipulates at most 10000 boxes, yielding an overall time complexity of `O(N log N)` due to sorting at each level.
