# SPOJ LABYR1 - Labyrinth

We are given a maze consisting of `.` free cells and `#` walls.  The maze
structure is a tree: between any two free cells there is exactly one simple
path.  For each test case we must find the longest distance between any two
free cells, measured as number of cells on the path.  This is the length of
the longest rope that might be needed to connect two hooks.

The diameter of a tree can be obtained by running BFS twice:

1. Start from an arbitrary free cell and run BFS to find the farthest cell.
2. Run BFS again from that farthest cell.  Its farthest distance is the length
   of the tree's diameter, which equals the required rope length.

The program reads the grid, finds any free cell, performs the two BFS passes
using a queue and a visited set, and prints
`"Maximum rope length is X."` for each test case.
