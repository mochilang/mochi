# SPOJ MKPALS - Making Pals

Given a sequence of decimal digits, you may delete or add a digit to either
end with cost 1. The goal is the smallest cost to form a palindrome; if
multiple palindromes share this minimal cost, choose the longest length.

Let `n` be the sequence length and `LPS` the length of its longest palindromic
subsequence. The minimal number of insertions or deletions needed is `n - LPS`.
Keeping the original digits and inserting only at the ends yields the longest
palindrome for this minimal cost, with final length `n + (n - LPS)`.

Algorithm:

1. Compute `LPS` using dynamic programming as the longest common subsequence
   between the string and its reverse. Complexity `O(n^2)`.
2. `cost = n - LPS`.
3. `length = n + cost`.
4. Output the case number, sequence, cost, and length for each line until a
   blank line is encountered.
