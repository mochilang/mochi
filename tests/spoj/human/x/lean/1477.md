# PT07A - Play with a Tree

Given a tree with some nodes fixed to the ground, two players remove edges. After removing an edge, any part of the tree no longer connected to a ground node disappears. The player who cannot move loses.

## Algorithm
1. **Skeleton** – Compute the minimal subtree containing all ground nodes by repeatedly pruning non-ground leaves. The remaining nodes and edges form the *skeleton*.
2. **Skeleton parity** – Cutting any skeleton edge only removes that edge, so the skeleton contributes `(#edges mod 2)` to the Grundy value.
3. **Branches** – For every edge from a skeleton node to a pruned subtree, treat the subtree as a normal rooted tree game (with the skeleton node as ground). Its Grundy value is computed recursively: `sg(u) = xor (sg(child) + 1)`.
4. **Result** – XOR the skeleton parity with all branch Grundy values. If the final value is non-zero, the first player wins; otherwise the second player wins.

The overall complexity is `O(N)` per test case.
