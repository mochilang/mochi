# WATERWAY - The Water Ringroad

We enumerate every ordered pair of distinct cities. For each pair we check if a path exists in the anticlockwise direction, in the clockwise direction, or both. When both exist we take the shorter of the two paths (ties favour the anticlockwise one). The chosen path contributes one to a counter for every arc it traverses. After processing all pairs we output the maximum counter value across all arcs; this number is the minimum number of disjoint circular channels required.

This implementation follows the problem statement directly and is intended for educational purposes; it is not optimised for large inputs.
