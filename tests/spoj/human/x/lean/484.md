# TFOSS - Fossil in the Ice

The probes mark points of a fossil.  We need the square of the maximum
Euclidean distance between any two probes.

1. **Convex hull:** sort the points lexicographically and build the lower and
   upper hulls with the monotonic chain algorithm.  All potential farthest
   pairs lie on the hull.
2. **Rotating calipers:** iterate around the hull while maintaining an
   antipodal point for each edge to find the farthest pair.  Update the maximum
   squared distance.

This runs in \(O(n \log n)\) time for \(n\) points.
