# [Rhombs](https://www.spoj.com/problems/RHOMBS)

## Problem Summary
Given a simple polygon drawn on a triangular grid that can be tiled entirely by rhombs (pairs of adjacent triangles), determine how many rhombs of each of the three orientations (A, B, C) appear in such a tiling.

## Algorithm
1. Walk around the polygon, tracking coordinates in the cube system `(x,y,z)` where directions 1..6 correspond to steps `(1,0,-1), (1,-1,0), (0,-1,1), (-1,0,1), (-1,1,0), (0,1,-1)`.
2. For every edge from `(x,y,z)` to `(x',y',z')`, accumulate twice the area as `area += y*z' - y'*z` and update the position. Simultaneously sum the total lengths in each of the six directions.
3. After processing all edges, let `area = |area|`, `n1 = n1 + n4`, `n2 = n2 + n5`, `n3 = n3 + n6`.
4. The rhomb counts follow from the boundary invariants:
   - `A = (area - 2*n1 + n2 + n3) / 6`
   - `B = (area - 2*n2 + n3 + n1) / 6`
   - `C = (area - 2*n3 + n1 + n2) / 6`
5. Output `A B C`.

## Complexity
Let `n` be the number of sides (≤ 50000) and the total length be ≤ 100000. The algorithm runs in `O(n)` time and uses `O(1)` additional memory.
