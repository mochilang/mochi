An unbounded triangular grid is a plane covered by equilateral triangles:

Two neighboring triangles in the grid form a rhomb. There are 3 types of such
rhombs:

A grid polygon is a simple polygon which sides consist entirely of sides of
triangles in the grid. We say that a grid polygon is rhombastic if it can be
partitioned into internally disjoint rhombs of types A, B and C.

As an example let's consider the following grid hexagon:

![rhombs](/content/adrian:rhomb3.png)

This hexagon can be partitioned into 4 rhombs of type A, 4 rhombs of type B and
4 rhombs of type C:

For a given rhombastic grid polygon P compute the numbers of rhombs of types A,
B and C in some correct partition.

### Task

Write a program that:

- reads a description of a rhombastic grid polygon from the standard input,

- computes the numbers of rhombs of types A, B and C in some correct partition of
the polygon,

- writes the results to the standard output.

### Input

The input begins with the integer t, the number of test cases. Then t test
cases follow.

For each test case the first line of the input contains an integer n (3 ≤ n
≤ 50000) - the number of sides of a rhombastic grid polygon. Each of the
next n lines contains a description of one side of the polygon. The sides are
given one by one in the clockwise order. No two consecutive sides of the
polygon lie on the same straight line. The description of a side consists of
two integers d and k. Integer d says what is the direction of the side
according to the following figure:

Integer k is the length of the polygon side measured in the number of sides of
grid triangles. Sum of all numbers k is not larger than 100000.

### Output

For each test case the first and only line of the output contains three
integers separated by single spaces denoting the number of rhombs of type A, B
and C respectively, in some partition of the input polygon.

### Example

Sample input:
1
6
1 2
2 2
3 2
4 2
5 2
6 2

Sample output:
4 4 4
