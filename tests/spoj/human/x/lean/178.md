# ROADNET - Road net

For each test case we are given an $n \times n$ matrix of shortest path
lengths between all pairs of towns.  Two towns $i$ and $j$ are **neighbours**
if there is no intermediate town $k$ such that
$dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]$.

The algorithm simply checks every pair $(i,j)$ with $i < j$ and searches for a
witness town $k$.  If none exists, the pair is reported.  Pairs are generated
in increasing order and test cases are separated by a blank line.

The complexity per test case is $O(n^3)$ which is fine for $n \le 200$.
