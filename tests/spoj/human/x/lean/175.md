## Problem Summary
Given a convex polygon with `n` vertices and a triangulation consisting of `n-2` triangles, determine the maximum number of triangles in the triangulation that can be intersected by any elementary triangle (a triangle whose vertices are polygon vertices).

## Algorithm
1. Construct the **dual tree** of the triangulation. Each triangle is a node and triangles sharing a diagonal are connected.
2. For each polygon boundary edge, add a leaf node attached to the triangle containing that edge. The resulting tree has `n-2` internal nodes and `n` leaves.
3. For each triangle node as potential centre:
   - Perform BFS to determine, for every incident branch, the maximum distance to a boundary leaf.
   - Take the three largest distances `d1`, `d2`, `d3`; they correspond to three boundary edges whose minimal connecting subtree passes through the current triangle.
   - The number of intersected triangles for this centre is `d1 + d2 + d3 - 2`.
4. The answer is the maximum value over all triangle nodes.

The BFS from each triangle runs in `O(n)` time and there are at most `n` triangles, giving an overall `O(n^2)` algorithm which is adequate for `n â‰¤ 1000`.
