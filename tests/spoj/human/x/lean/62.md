# [The Imp](https://www.spoj.com/problems/IMP/)

## Problem Summary
Given two vectors `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` describing how an imp can move on an infinite chessboard, find the smallest possible value of `|x| + |y|` for a non-zero square `(x, y)` reachable from `(0, 0)` by repeatedly applying the moves or their negatives. Input consists of ten test cases with four integers per line.

## Algorithm
Every square the imp can reach is an integer linear combination of the two move vectors. This set forms a 2‑dimensional lattice generated by `v1 = (a, b)` and `v2 = (c, d)`. The task reduces to finding the non-zero lattice vector with the smallest Manhattan norm `|x| + |y|`.

We apply Gauss lattice reduction to obtain a short nearly orthogonal basis:
1. Reorder vectors so that `‖v1‖ ≤ ‖v2‖` with squared Euclidean norm.
2. Compute `μ = round((v1 · v2) / ‖v1‖²)`. If `μ ≠ 0`, replace `v2 ← v2 − μ v1` and repeat.
3. Stop when `μ = 0` or one vector becomes zero.

For a reduced basis, the shortest vector in any symmetric norm lies among `{v1, v2, v1 + v2, v1 − v2}`. We evaluate these candidates and output the minimum `|x| + |y|`.

The reduction and candidate evaluation operate entirely with 64‑bit integers, so the computation is efficient even for large inputs.
