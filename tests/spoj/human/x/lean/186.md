# [The lightest language](https://www.spoj.com/problems/LITELANG/)

## Problem Summary
Given an alphabet with `k` letters where each letter has a positive weight, determine the minimal total weight of a prefixless language consisting of `n` words. The weight of a word is the sum of its letters' weights and the language weight is the sum of its words.

## Algorithm
1. Read `n`, `k` and the `k` letter weights.
2. To obtain at least `n` prefix-free words, repeatedly expand the cheapest current word:
   - Expanding a word replaces it by `k` extensions, increasing the number of available words by `k-1`.
   - The minimal number of expansions is `ceil((n-1)/(k-1))`.
3. Maintain the current set of words as their weights in an array.
   - In each expansion, remove the smallest weight and add its `k` extensions by adding each letter weight.
4. After all expansions, sort the array and sum the smallest `n` weights.

This approach has time complexity `O(n * k + n log n)` and works within the limits (`n ≤ 10⁴`, `k ≤ 26`).
