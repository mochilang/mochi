# STABLEMP - Stable Marriage Problem

This task asks to find a stable matching for `n` men and `n` women.  
Each woman lists all men in order of preference and each man lists all women.  
A matching is *stable* if there is no man `m` and woman `w` who prefer each other over their current partners.

## Algorithm

The implementation uses the Galeâ€“Shapley algorithm where men propose:

1. All men start free and each keeps the index of the next woman to propose to.
2. While there is a free man `m`:
   - `m` proposes to the next woman `w` on his preference list.
   - If `w` is free, they become engaged.
   - Otherwise `w` compares `m` with her current partner using a precomputed ranking table.  
     She keeps the better partner and the rejected man becomes free again.
3. When no man is free, engagements form a stable matching that is optimal for men.

The complexity is `O(n^2)` for each test case because every proposal advances a man's pointer and each man proposes at most `n` times.
