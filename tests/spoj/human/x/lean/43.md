## Problem Summary
Given `m` books with page counts `p1..pm` and `k` scribes (`k â‰¤ m`),
partition the books into `k` contiguous groups so that the largest
sum assigned to any scriber is as small as possible.  Among all optimal
partitions choose the one that minimizes the work of the first scriber,
then the second, and so on.  Each scriber must receive at least one book.

## Algorithm
1. Binary search the minimal possible maximum number of pages per scriber
   between the largest single book and the total sum of pages.
2. For a candidate limit, greedily scan from the start counting how many
   scribers are required if no scriber exceeds that limit.
3. After the limit is found, reconstruct the partition from the end:
   move backwards and start a new scriber whenever adding the next book
   would exceed the limit or when the remaining books equal the remaining
   scribers.
4. Print page counts separated by spaces, inserting ` / ` where partitions
   occur.

This approach runs in `O(m log S)` per test case where `S` is the total
number of pages and uses `O(m)` additional space for the partition marks.
