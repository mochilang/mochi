## Problem Summary
Given a small undirected weighted graph (each vertex has degree at most four),
find the length of the shortest simple cycle and how many such cycles exist.
If the graph contains no cycle output `0 0`.

## Algorithm
1. Build adjacency lists for all intersections.
2. For every vertex `s` treat it as the smallest vertex in a potential cycle.
   Explore all simple paths starting from `s` using depthâ€‘first search but only
   visiting vertices with indices greater than `s`. This guarantees that each
   cycle is considered exactly once.
3. During DFS keep the current length and the list of visited vertices.
   Whenever an edge leads back to `s` and at least two other vertices have been
   visited, a simple cycle is found. Update the best length and count, pruning
   any search branch whose length already exceeds the best found so far.
4. After processing all start vertices output the minimal length and the number
   of such cycles, or `0 0` if none were discovered.

This straightforward enumeration is sufficient for the small test data and the
low vertex degree.
