# Solution for SPOJ EXPAND - Barn Expansion

The farm has several axis-aligned rectangular barns that never overlap. A barn can be expanded only if it does not touch another barn along any wall or at any corner. We must count how many barns are isolated in this manner.

## Algorithm

1. Parse the `n` rectangles of each test case.
2. For every pair of rectangles, check whether their closed regions intersect. Because the input guarantees no overlaps, any intersection indicates the barns share a side or a corner.
3. If two rectangles touch, mark both as non-expandable.
4. After all pairs are processed, count the barns still marked expandable and output this number.

The intersection test for rectangles `r1` and `r2` uses:
`¬(r1.c < r2.a ∨ r2.c < r1.a ∨ r1.d < r2.b ∨ r2.d < r1.b)`.

## Complexity

The algorithm examines all pairs of rectangles, resulting in `O(n^2)` time per test case and constant additional space.
