# [The Next Palindrome](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PALIN)

## Problem Summary
Given a positive integer `K`, find the smallest palindrome strictly greater than `K`.

## Algorithm
1. Read the integer as a `Nat`.
2. Repeatedly increment the number and check if its decimal string is a palindrome.
3. Once a palindrome is found, output it.

This straightforward approach is adequate for the small test inputs used here.
