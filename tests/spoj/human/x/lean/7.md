# [The Bulk!](https://www.spoj.com/problems/BULK)

## Problem Summary
Given the polygonal faces of a 3‑D object composed of unit cubes, determine its volume in unit cubes. Faces are axis-aligned polygons; the object may have holes but is connected.

## Algorithm
1. Read all faces. Record every x, y and z coordinate and keep faces that are perpendicular to the x‑axis (all x coordinates equal). For such faces store their x coordinate and the polygon formed by their (y, z) pairs.
2. Build sorted unique lists of all x, y and z coordinates and augment them with 0 and 1001 to create an enclosing grid.
3. Sweep all rectangular cells defined by consecutive coordinates.
   - For each cell center `(xmid, ymid, zmid)` cast a ray in +x direction.
   - Count how many stored faces with `xmid < face.x` contain `(ymid, zmid)` (point-in-polygon test).
   - If the count is odd, the cell lies inside the bulk and its volume `dx*dy*dz` contributes to the answer.
4. Sum the volume of all inside cells and print `"The bulk is composed of V units."`.

The approach works because the even–odd rule with the vertical sweep correctly distinguishes interior from exterior. Complexity is proportional to the number of grid cells.
