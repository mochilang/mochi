The problem asks for the expected number of rolls of an unbiased \(N\)-sided die until every face has appeared at least once.
This is the classical *coupon collector* problem. After \(k\) distinct faces have been seen, the probability that the next
roll yields a new face is \(\frac{N-k}{N}\), so the expected number of rolls to obtain the \((k+1)\)-th new face is
\(\frac{N}{N-k}\). Summing this from \(k = 0\) to \(N-1\) gives
\(N \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{i} = N H_N\) where \(H_N\) is the \(N\)-th harmonic number.

The program computes the harmonic number by summing \(1/i\) for \(i = 1\) to \(N\), multiplies by \(N\), and formats the
result to two decimal places.
