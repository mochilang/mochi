## Problem Summary
A circuit is described on a 10Ã—10 grid. Each cell may contain one of five gates: AND (`&`), OR (`|`), NOT (`!`), input (`i`) or output (`o`).
For every gate, the coordinates of the cells that consume its output are listed. After all gates are defined, a number of test vectors is provided. Each vector assigns boolean values to the inputs (in the order the input gates were defined). For every vector, the circuit must be evaluated and the values of all output gates (again in definition order) must be printed.

## Algorithm
1. Parse the circuit description and build a map from coordinates to gate information.
   * While reading each gate line, record the order of input and output gates.
   * For every listed connection `XY`, append the current gate's coordinate to the input list of cell `XY`.
2. For each test vector:
   * Assign its bits to the input gates using the recorded order.
   * Recursively evaluate every output gate. Each gate fetches the values of its input gates, memoising intermediate results to avoid recomputation.
   * Emit `0`/`1` characters for outputs in their definition order.
3. Print a blank line after processing all test cases of a circuit.

The circuit forms a DAG, so recursive evaluation terminates. Each gate is visited at most once per test case, giving linear time in the number of gates.
