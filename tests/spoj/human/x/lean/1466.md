# CASHIER - Blue Mary Needs Help Again

## Algorithm

We maintain all workers' wages in a sorted array, but instead of storing
actual wages we keep them shifted by a global offset.  The variable `offset`
represents the amount added to all wages so far.

* `I K` – insert a worker if `K ≥ MIN`.  We store `K - offset` in the array
  using binary search to keep it sorted.
* `A K` – increase the global offset by `K`.
* `S K` – decrease the global offset by `K` and delete every stored value that
  becomes smaller than `MIN - offset`.  The count of removed elements is
  accumulated.
* `F K` – if we have at least `K` workers, the `K`‑th largest wage equals the
  element at index `size - K` in the array plus `offset`; otherwise we print
  `-1`.

The array operations are logarithmic for the binary searches and linear for the
actual insertion or deletion.  Given the input limits this straightforward
approach is sufficient.
