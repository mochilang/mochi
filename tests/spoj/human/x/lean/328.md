# [Bishops](https://www.spoj.com/problems/BISHOPS/)

## Problem Summary
Given the size \(N\) of a chessboard \((1 \le N \le 10^{100})\), compute the maximum number of bishops that can be placed so that no two attack each other. Input may contain multiple test cases, one per line.

## Algorithm
1. For each input line, parse \(N\) as an arbitrary-precision natural number.
2. If \(N \le 1\), the answer is simply \(N\).
3. Otherwise, bishops on black and white squares do not interact. Each color can hold at most \(N-1\) bishops, giving a total of \(2N-2\).
4. Output the computed value for each \(N\).

This algorithm runs in constant time and space per test case using big integer arithmetic.
