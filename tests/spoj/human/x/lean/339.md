# SEQ - Recursive Sequence

We are given the first `k` terms `b1..bk` of a sequence and coefficients `c1..ck`
for the linear recurrence

`a_i = c1*a_{i-1} + c2*a_{i-2} + ... + ck*a_{i-k}` for `i > k`.
The task is to compute `a_n` modulo `10^9` for large `n` (up to `10^9`).

Represent the recurrence as a `k x k` transition matrix `T`:

```
| c1 c2 ... ck |
| 1  0 ... 0  |
| 0  1 ... 0  |
| ...          |
| 0 ... 1  0 |
```

For any `i ≥ k`, the vector `[a_i, a_{i-1}, ..., a_{i-k+1}]^T` equals
`T^(i-k) * [a_k, a_{k-1}, ..., a_1]^T`. Thus `a_n` is the first component of
`T^(n-k)` multiplied by the initial vector. Exponentiation is done with binary
powering, multiplying matrices modulo `10^9`.

This approach runs in `O(k^3 log n)` time with `O(k^2)` memory, which easily
handles the given constraints (`k ≤ 10`, `n ≤ 10^9`).
