# QUILT - Little Quilt

Link: https://www.spoj.com/problems/QUILT/

## Algorithm

- Strip all whitespace and split the input by semicolons to obtain individual expressions.
- Parse expressions recursively using the grammar:
  - `A` and `B` are primitive 2x2 quilts.
  - `turn(x)` rotates a quilt 90° clockwise. The rotation also transforms characters:
    `-`↔`|`, `/`↔`\`, `+` stays the same.
  - `sew(x,y)` concatenates two quilts horizontally if their heights match; otherwise the evaluation fails.
- Evaluate the parsed expression on the fly and output either the resulting ASCII quilt or `error`.

## Complexity

Let `n` be the size of the resulting quilt. Each rotation or sewing traverses all characters of its arguments, so the complexity is `O(n)` for each operation. The overall runtime is linear in the size of the final quilt.
