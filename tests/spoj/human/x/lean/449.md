# Solution for SPOJ TCNUMFL - Simple Numbers with Fractions Conversion

The task is to convert a number from base `r` to base `s` while producing
exactly `l` digits after the decimal point (comma). Digits may include `0-9`
and `A-Z` for values `10-35`.

## Algorithm

1. Split the input number at the comma into integer and fractional parts.
2. Convert each part from base `r` to a natural number.
   - For the fractional part with `k` digits, compute its value as
     `fracVal / r^k`.
3. The whole number equals
   `numerator / denominator` where
   `numerator = intVal * r^k + fracVal` and `denominator = r^k`.
4. To obtain `l` digits in base `s`, compute
   `scaled = floor(numerator * s^l / denominator)`.
   - The integer part is `scaled / s^l`.
   - The fractional part is `scaled % s^l`.
5. Convert both parts to base `s` and pad the fractional part with leading
   zeros to length `l`.
6. Print the result, omitting the comma when `l = 0`.

## Correctness

- Step 2 correctly interprets the input number since each digit contributes
  its positional value in base `r`.
- `numerator / denominator` represents the original number exactly.
- Multiplying by `s^l` and taking the floor implements base conversion with
  truncation (no rounding) after `l` fractional digits.
- Converting the integer and fractional parts separately and padding ensures
  the output has exactly `l` digits after the comma in base `s`.

## Complexity

Let `n` be the number of digits in the input and `l` the number of requested
fractional digits. The conversion uses arithmetic on integers of at most
`O(n + l)` digits and each operation is linear in that size, giving an overall
complexity of `O(n + l)` big-digit operations per test case.
