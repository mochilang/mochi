# PIE - Pie

We are given `N` cylindrical pies of radius `ri` (height `1`) and need to share them
among `F` friends plus the host. Each person must receive a single contiguous piece
of pie and all pieces must have the same volume. We must find the maximum possible
volume of one piece.

The volume of a pie with radius `r` is `Ï€ r^2`. If we cut pieces of volume `V`, a pie
of volume `vol` yields `floor(vol / V)` pieces. The total number of pieces obtainable
for volume `V` is the sum over all pies. We need this count to be at least `F + 1`.

To maximize `V` we perform binary search on the piece size. The lower bound is `0`
and the upper bound is the largest pie volume. For each mid value we compute how
many pieces can be obtained and adjust the bounds accordingly. After sufficient
iterations the lower bound approximates the maximum volume. The final answer is
printed with four decimal places.
