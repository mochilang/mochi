# NECKLACE - Necklace

[Problem](https://www.spoj.com/problems/NECKLACE/)

Given points `P_i` we must choose radii `r_i` so that circles at these points
intersect only with their immediate neighbours in the cycle.

Let `d_i` be distance between `P_i` and `P_{i+1}` (with `P_{n+1}=P_1`).
If we set `r_i + r_{i+1} = d_i` for every `i`, every radius becomes a linear
expression in `x = r_1` of the form `r_i = s_i*x + c_i` where `s_i` alternates
between `1` and `-1` and `c_i` is built from the distances.

* When `n` is odd the cycle yields `x = c/2`, giving a unique set of radii.
* When `n` is even `x` is free.  Bounds on `x` come from `r_i ≥ 0` and the
  requirement `r_i + r_j ≤ d_{ij}` for non‑adjacent circles.  Intersecting these
  linear constraints gives an interval `[L, U]`; any value inside works.  The
  implementation takes the midpoint `(L+U)/2`.

The radii are then `r_i = s_i*x + c_i`.  This satisfies all required
intersections and avoids others.  Computing all pairwise distances for the
constraints makes the algorithm `O(n^2)` with `n ≤ 100`.
