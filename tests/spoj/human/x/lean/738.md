# TREE - Another Counting Problem

[Problem link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TREE/)

For each pair `(n, d)` we must count the number of strictly `n`-ary trees of depth `d`.
A strictly `n`-ary tree is one where each internal node has exactly `n` children.
Depth is the length of the longest root-to-leaf path; at least one path must have length `d`.

Let `S(d)` be the number of strictly `n`-ary trees whose depth is at most `d`.
For `d = 0` there is only the single-node tree, so `S(0) = 1`.
For `d > 0`, the root may either be a leaf or an internal node with `n` subtrees of depth `â‰¤ d-1`.
Therefore

```
S(d) = 1 + (S(d-1))^n.
```

The number of trees of depth exactly `d` is `T(d) = S(d) - S(d-1)`.
We compute `S(d)` iteratively using the recurrence and big integers (`Nat` in Lean) and
output `n d T(d)` for each test case until the terminating `0 0` pair.
