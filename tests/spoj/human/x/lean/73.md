# SPOJ BAC - Bacterial

We are given the width and height of a rectangular plate and the integer coordinates of bacterial samples planted on it. Each sample expands uniformly in all directions at the same rate. When growing regions meet or hit the border of the plate they stop, so each sample ends up occupying a polygonal region inside the rectangle. For every test case we must report the area dominated by each sample sorted in decreasing order.

For a fixed sample its territory is the intersection of the plate with all half-planes consisting of points closer to this sample than to any other. These half-planes are bounded by the perpendicular bisectors of the segments joining the sample with the others. The polygon can therefore be obtained by starting with the rectangle and repeatedly clipping it with those bisector half-planes (Sutherlandâ€“Hodgman algorithm for convex polygons). After processing all other samples the remaining polygon is the Voronoi cell for that sample, and its area is computed by the shoelace formula.

We perform this procedure for every sample, collect the areas, sort the pairs `(id, area)` in descending order by area and output each line with the id padded to three digits and the area printed to two decimal places.
