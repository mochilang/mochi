# Is it a tree?

[Problem link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PT07Y/)

Given an undirected graph, decide whether it forms a tree.

## Algorithm

A graph with `N` vertices is a tree iff it is connected and has exactly `N-1` edges.
We therefore:

- Read `N` and `M`. If `M ≠ N-1`, the graph cannot be a tree.
- Use a disjoint-set union (union-find) structure to connect the endpoints of each edge.
  If an edge connects two already‑connected vertices, a cycle exists and we return `NO`.
- After processing edges, find the representative of vertex `1` and ensure every
  vertex has the same representative; otherwise the graph is disconnected.
- If all checks pass, output `YES`, otherwise `NO`.

This approach runs in nearly linear time with respect to the number of edges.
