# SPOJ OPTSUB - Optimal Connected Subset

* Build a map from each coordinate to its index and connect any pair of points whose Manhattan distance is one.  Because the input is a singular set of integer points, this graph is a tree.
* Run a depth-first search with dynamic programming.  For each node `u`, compute the best total for a connected subset that includes `u`:
  `sum[u] = weight[u] + Î£_{v child of u} max(0, sum[v])`.
* Track the maximum value of `sum[u]` over all nodes; this is the total score of the optimal connected subset.
* The algorithm processes each node and edge once, so the complexity is `O(N)` per test case.
