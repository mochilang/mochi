# Solution for SPOJ EXPEDI - Expedition

The truck starts `L` units from town with `P` units of fuel. Each stop is given as
its distance from the town and the amount of fuel available. The goal is to reach
the town using the fewest refuelling stops.

## Algorithm

1. Convert each stop's distance from the town to distance from the starting
   position (`L - d`). Add a final dummy stop at distance `L` with `0` fuel to
   represent the town.
2. Sort all stops by distance from the starting position.
3. Traverse the stops in order, keeping the distance travelled since the last
   stop. Maintain a max-heap of fuel amounts from stops that have been passed.
4. Before moving to the next stop, while the current fuel is insufficient for the
   required distance, pop the largest amount from the heap and refuel. If the heap
   is empty, the destination is unreachable.
5. After reaching each stop, push its fuel into the heap and continue.
6. The number of times fuel is popped from the heap equals the minimal number of
   refuelling stops.

## Correctness

- At any point, all fuel from stops already passed is available in the heap. Using
  the largest available fuel first greedily postpones future refuelling and
  minimizes the number of stops.
- Stops are processed in the order they are encountered, ensuring that any stop
  can only be used after reaching it.
- If the heap becomes empty before we have enough fuel to reach the next stop,
  no sequence of refuels can reach the town, so the answer is `-1`.

## Complexity

Let `N` be the number of fuel stops. Sorting takes `O(N log N)`. Each stop is
inserted and removed from the heap at most once, giving overall complexity
`O(N log N)`.
