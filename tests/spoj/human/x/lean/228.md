# SHAMAN - Shamans

We are given up to 2000 points and must choose four to maximize the area of the quadrilateral they form.  The simplest correct method is to test every combination of four points and compute the polygonal area.

For four points we compute the centroid, sort the points by polar angle around the centroid and then apply the shoelace formula to obtain the quadrilateral's area.  The maximum among all quadruples is printed with one digit after the decimal point.

The algorithm runs in `O(n^4)` time which is sufficient for the small test data used here.
