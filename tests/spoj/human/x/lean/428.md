# PARTPALI - Particular Palindromes

[Problem Link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PARTPALI/)

## Algorithm

1. Precompute powers of 10 modulo `m` up to `s` digits.
2. Use dynamic programming on the first half of the palindrome.
   - For each position `i` in the first half, update counts for all possible remainders of constructing symmetric digit pairs.
   - The most significant digit cannot be zero.
3. If `s` is odd, process the middle digit separately (also non-zero when `s = 1`).
4. The answer is the count of constructions whose remainder is `0` after all digits are set.

## Complexity

Time complexity is `O(s * m * 10)` and memory usage is `O(m)`.
