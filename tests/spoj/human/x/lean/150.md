## Problem Summary
A city is laid out as a grid of streets. Each of n friends lives at an
intersection with integer coordinates. They want to meet at one friend's
home so that the total walking distance for all of them is minimized.
Walking is only along the streets, giving Manhattan distance.
For each test case we must compute that minimal total distance.

## Algorithm
1. Read all x and y coordinates into separate arrays.
2. Sort the array of x-values and the array of y-values.
3. The optimal meeting point is at the median x and median y.
4. Sum the Manhattan distance from each friend to this median point and
   output the total.

## Complexity
Sorting dominates. For n friends the time complexity is O(n log n) and
O(n) memory is required to store the coordinates.
