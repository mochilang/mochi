## Problem Summary
Read integers from standard input and print each on its own line until the sentinel value `42` is encountered. The value `42` and any numbers after it should not be output.

## Algorithm
1. Continuously read lines from standard input.
2. For each line, attempt to parse it as an integer.
3. If the parsed value is `42`, terminate the loop.
4. Otherwise, print the value and continue reading.
5. Stop processing when end-of-file is reached.

The algorithm runs in linear time relative to the number of input lines and uses constant additional memory.
