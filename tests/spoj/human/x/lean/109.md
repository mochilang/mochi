# EXCHNG - Exchanges

[Problem Link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/EXCHNG/)

## Algorithm

1. Build an undirected graph where vertices correspond to registers and an edge exists for each `CE(a,b)` instruction.
2. For each vertex count how many distinct neighbours it has (degree ignoring duplicate edges).
3. The program is reliable only if every register participates in at least two exchanges. Each register with degree `< 2` requires one additional instruction.
4. Output the number of such registers.

## Complexity

Let `n` be the number of registers and `m` the number of instructions. Building the adjacency sets and counting degrees takes `O(n + m)` time and `O(n + m)` memory.
