## Problem Summary
Given a necklace described by a string `A` of length `n`, find the position `i` (1-indexed) where breaking the necklace produces the lexicographically smallest rotation of `A`. Multiple test cases are provided.

## Algorithm
We use **Booth's algorithm** to compute the lexicographically minimal rotation in linear time:

1. Convert the string into an array of characters and duplicate it (`A + A`) so every rotation is a substring.
2. Maintain two candidate starting indices `i` and `j` and an offset `k`.
   - Compare characters at `i + k` and `j + k`.
   - If equal, increment `k`.
   - If they differ, discard the larger rotation by advancing the corresponding index by `k + 1` and reset `k`.
3. Continue until either index reaches `n` or `k = n`. The smaller index corresponds to the minimal rotation.
4. Add one to convert the 0-based index to 1-based and output it.

The procedure processes each string in `O(n)` time and uses `O(n)` additional space.
