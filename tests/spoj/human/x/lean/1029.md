# MATSUM - Matrix Summation

[Problem statement](https://www.spoj.com/problems/MATSUM/)

## Algorithm

We maintain an `N×N` matrix of integers. The commands are processed as
follows:

* `SET x y num` – update cell `(x,y)` with the given value.
* `SUM x1 y1 x2 y2` – accumulate all values in the submatrix with corners
  `(x1,y1)` and `(x2,y2)` using nested loops and print the sum.
* `END` – finish the current test case and output a blank line.

This direct approach illustrates the problem mechanics. For large inputs the
usual optimisation is to replace the nested loops with a 2‑D Binary Indexed
Tree to achieve `O(log² N)` per query.
