# MKMONEY - Making Money

Given a principal $P$, annual interest rate $I$ percent, and a number of compounding periods $C$, compute the value after one year when interest is compounded $C$ times and each earned interest is truncated to whole cents.

## Algorithm

1. Read triples `(P, I, C)` until `0.00 0.00 0`.
2. Convert `P` to integer cents and `I` to basis points (hundredths of a percent).
3. Repeat `C` times:
   - `interest = principal * I / (10000 * C)` using integer division to floor to cents.
   - `principal += interest`.
4. Format the final principal back to `dollars.cents` with two digits and output:
   `Case x. $P at I% APR compounded C times yields $result`.

The integer arithmetic automatically handles truncation of fractional cents.
