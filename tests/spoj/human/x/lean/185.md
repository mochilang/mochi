## Problem Summary
Given a triangle-free connected board represented as an undirected graph, two players start on distinct squares. In each turn player A moves first, then player B; each may stay or move to an adjacent square. Determine whether B can guarantee catching A regardless of A's strategy and, if possible, the minimal number of turns needed.

## Algorithm
1. Represent every game configuration as a state `(a, b, turn)` where `a` and `b` are the current squares of players A and B and `turn` indicates whose move is next.
2. For each state compute all predecessors – states that can lead to it in one move.
3. Initialise all states with `a = b` as winning for B with distance `0`.
4. Run a retrograde breadth‑first search over the state space:
   - Process states from the queue and propagate their result to predecessors.
   - If the player to move in a predecessor has a move to a state winning for them, mark the predecessor as a win for that player.
   - Otherwise, decrement the remaining move count. When all moves lead to the opponent’s win, mark the predecessor as a win for the opponent.
   - Record move counts to measure how many steps are needed for B to catch A.
5. After processing completes, inspect the initial state `(a₀, b₀, A-turn)`. If it is winning for B, the answer is `(moves + 1) / 2` turns (since two moves form a turn). Otherwise, output `No`.

The search only explores reachable states and correctly evaluates optimal play, yielding `O(n² · deg)` complexity in the worst case.
