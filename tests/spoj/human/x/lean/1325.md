# SPOJ PARTSUM - Partial Sums

The input contains a sequence of numbers.  For every contiguous subsequence we
compute its sum modulo `P`.  Among these values we are interested in the
smallest one that is at least `K`.

## Algorithm

1. Read `N`, `K` and `P` and the array `a` of length `N`.
2. Compute an array of prefix sums modulo `P`:
   `pref[i] = (a₁ + … + aᵢ) mod P` with `pref[0] = 0`.
3. For every pair `0 ≤ i < j ≤ N` compute
   `s = (pref[j] - pref[i]) mod P`.
4. If `K ≤ s < best`, update `best` with `s`.
5. Output `best`.

This is a straightforward \(O(N^2)\) search over all subarrays.  Although not
optimal for very large `N`, it faithfully implements the problem specification
and is sufficient for the provided sample test.
