## Algorithm

1. For each test case read the grid consisting of `F` (free) and `R` (reserved) cells.
2. Maintain an array `heights` of size `N` that stores, for each column, how many
   consecutive free cells have appeared ending at the current row.
   When a reserved cell is encountered the height resets to zero.
3. After updating the heights for a row, compute the largest rectangle area in the
   histogram described by `heights`.
   This uses the standard stack technique:
   - Scan from left to right while keeping indices of non‑decreasing heights on a stack.
   - When a smaller height is seen, repeatedly pop the stack and compute areas using the
     popped height as the limiting bar.
   - After the scan, process the remaining stack.
4. Track the maximal rectangle area over all rows and multiply it by 3 – the rent per cell.
5. Print the profit for each dataset on its own line.

The algorithm runs in `O(M*N)` time per test case and `O(N)` additional memory.
