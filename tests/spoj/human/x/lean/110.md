# [Fill the Cisterns](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CISTFILL/)

## Problem Summary
Given several rectangular cisterns described by base level `b`, height `h`, width `w` and depth `d`, and a volume `V` of water, determine the water level after filling. If the volume exceeds the combined capacity of all cisterns, output `OVERFLOW`.

## Algorithm
1. Parse the cisterns, storing for each its base level `b`, top level `b+h`, and base area `w*d`.
2. Compute the total capacity. If it is less than `V`, print `OVERFLOW`.
3. Otherwise binary search the water level between `0` and the maximum top level.
   - For a candidate level `x`, the contribution of each cistern is `area * max(0, min(x, top) - base)`.
   - Sum all contributions to obtain the volume at level `x`.
   - If the volume is at least `V`, search the lower half; otherwise search the upper half.
4. After enough iterations the upper bound approximates the fill level. Output it rounded to two decimal places.

This approach runs in `O(n log H)` time where `H` is the range of heights.
