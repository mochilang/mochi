# SPOJ POTHOLE - Potholers

Chambers of the cave are numbered so that all corridors go from a lower number to a higher number.
A training group uses a path from chamber `1` (Top) to chamber `n` (Bottom).
Each speleologist must use a distinct corridor leaving chamber `1` and a distinct
corridor entering chamber `n`, while other corridors may be shared.

For every test case:

1. Build the directed graph from the input.
2. Let `S` be the neighbours of chamber `1` and `T` the vertices that have a direct
   corridor to chamber `n`.
3. For each `u` in `S` perform a breadth‑first search to see which vertices of `T`
   are reachable from `u`.  These reachabilities form a bipartite graph between
   `S` and `T`.
4. Run a DFS‑based augmenting path algorithm to find a maximum matching in this
   bipartite graph.  The size of the matching equals the maximal number of
   speleologists that can train simultaneously.

The limits (`n ≤ 200`) make this approach easily fast enough.
