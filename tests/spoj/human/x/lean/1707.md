# [Reliable Nets](https://www.spoj.com/problems/RELINETS/)

## Problem Summary
Given up to 15 buildings and up to 20 possible undirected connections with costs, find the cheapest subset of connections such that the resulting network remains connected even if any single connection fails. If no such network exists, report that no reliable net is possible.

## Algorithm
1. Enumerate all `2^m` subsets of the `m` edges.
2. For each subset compute its total cost and number of edges. Skip subsets with fewer than `n` edges since a 2-edge-connected graph needs at least `n` edges.
3. To verify a subset:
   - Build an adjacency list for the chosen edges.
   - Check connectivity using depth-first search.
   - For every edge in the subset remove it and check connectivity again. If any removal disconnects the graph, the subset is not reliable.
4. Track the minimum cost among all reliable subsets. If none are reliable, there is no solution.

The exhaustive search is feasible because `m â‰¤ 20` resulting in at most about one million subsets.
