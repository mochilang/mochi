## Problem Summary
Given a rectangular room of width `X` and height `Y` containing `M` holes at integer coordinates, find the point inside the room that maximizes the distance to the nearest hole. Output the coordinates of this safest point rounded to one decimal place.

## Algorithm
1. **Read input** and store hole coordinates as floating point values.
2. **Search** for the point with maximum minimal distance using a hill‑climbing heuristic:
   - Start from each hole and the four room corners.
   - For each start point, repeatedly try moving in eight directions by a step size `s`.
   - If a move stays inside the rectangle and increases the distance to the nearest hole, accept it.
   - When no direction improves the distance, halve `s` and continue until `s < 0.01`.
3. Track the overall best position among all starting points.
4. **Round** the coordinates to one decimal place and print them in the required format.

The step‑shrinking hill climb converges quickly and is sufficient for the problem’s input limits (room up to 10k × 10k with up to 1000 holes).
