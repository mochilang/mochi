# SEQUENCE - Letter Sequence Analysis

## Algorithm

1. Read the entire input and keep only alphabetic characters.
2. Convert the filtered characters to uppercase to form a string `S`.
3. For each length `k` from 1 to 5:
   - Slide a window of size `k` over `S` and count occurrences of each substring.
   - Group substrings by their frequency.
   - Sort frequencies in descending order and, within each frequency, sort substrings alphabetically.
   - Output the five highest frequency groups (or fewer if not available).

## Complexity

Let `n` be the length of the filtered string. For each `k`, counting substrings and grouping them runs in `O(n)` time using hash maps. The overall time is `O(n)` and the additional memory usage is `O(n)` for the frequency maps.
