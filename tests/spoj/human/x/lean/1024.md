# Complete Chess Boards

[Problem link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/COMCB/)

We must find the lexicographically first knight's tour on a small chess board.
The board has at most 26 squares, columns are labeled `A..` and rows `1..`.
A tour starts from `A1` and must visit every square exactly once.

## Algorithm

- Represent board positions as `(row, column)` pairs.
- Perform depth‑first search starting from `(0,0)` (`A1`).
- From each square generate all legal knight moves within bounds.
- Sort the candidate moves by their textual form (e.g. `B3`), ensuring the
  lexicographically first complete tour is found.
- Recursively traverse unvisited squares, appending their names to the path.
- Backtrack when no further move is possible.
- If the DFS covers all `X×Y` squares, output the built path; otherwise output
  `-1` to indicate the board is not complete for a knight.
