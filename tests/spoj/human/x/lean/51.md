# Solution for [SPOJ TOUR - Fake tournament](https://www.spoj.com/problems/TOUR/)

We are given the results of every possible match between `n` contestants: for
contestant `i` the input lists all players that surely beat `i`.  This describes
an oriented complete graph (a tournament) where an edge `a → b` means `a` beats
`b`.

A contestant `x` can be made the champion if all players that can defeat `x`
can be eliminated before playing against `x`.  In tournament theory such
vertices are called **kings**: for every other vertex `y`, either `x` beats `y`
 directly or there exists a player `z` with `x → z → y`.

For each contestant we build the set of opponents they beat directly.  To check
whether a contestant `i` is a king we union that set with all players beaten by
those opponents (two-step reachability).  If this union covers every other
contestant then `i` can become the champion.

The algorithm processes each player and performs only simple set unions, giving
`O(n^3)` worst-case complexity which is fast enough for the given constraints
(`n ≤ 1000`).
