# SUMITR - Sums in a Triangle

Each test case provides a triangle of nonâ€‘negative integers.  We need the
maximum sum along a path from the top to the base, where from each element we
may move either directly below or below-right.

Dynamic programming processes the triangle row by row.  For each position `j`
of a row we keep the best sum achievable there.  When reading the next row we
compute the new value for position `j` as the current number plus the maximum of
the two possible parents (`j` and `j-1` from the previous row, missing parents
contribute `0`).  After the last row, the answer is the maximum value in the
array of sums.

The triangle has fewer than 100 rows and the algorithm runs in `O(n^2)` time
per test case, easily meeting the limits.
