# Partition the sequence

We are given `n` numbers and must split them into exactly `k` contiguous
segments so that the maximum segment sum is as small as possible.

The answer can be found with binary search.  For a candidate limit `M` we
check whether the array can be divided into at most `k` segments with each
segment sum `≤ M`.  We scan the array from left to right, accumulating the
current segment sum and starting a new segment whenever adding the next number
would exceed `M`.  If an individual number is larger than `M` the candidate is
impossible.  The smallest `M` for which the check succeeds is the result.

The numbers on SPOJ for this task are non‑negative which makes the greedy check
correct.  The overall running time is `O(n log S)` where `S` is the sum of the
sequence values.
