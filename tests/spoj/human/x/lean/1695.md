# [Grandpa's Rubik Cube](https://www.spoj.com/problems/GRC/)

## Problem Summary
Given a 3×3 Rubik's cube configuration and a list of face rotations, determine
whether the rotations lead to a solved cube. Faces are numbered from 1 to 6
(Left, Front, Right, Back, Up, Down) and positive values denote clockwise
rotations while negative values denote counter‑clockwise rotations.

## Algorithm
1. Parse the unfolded cube net into six 3×3 faces stored in an array.
2. For each move, rotate the chosen face and permute the adjoining edge
   stickers according to Rubik's cube mechanics.
3. After processing all moves, check whether each face contains nine identical
   colors.
4. If all faces are uniform print `"Yes, grandpa!"`; otherwise print
   `"No, you are wrong!"`.

The state updates and final check run in O(m) time for m moves.
