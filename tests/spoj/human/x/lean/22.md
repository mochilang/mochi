# SPOJ TRICENTR - Triangle and Centroid

Given side `a` and the distances from the centroid `G` to the three sides
`g_a`, `g_b` and `g_c` we compute two quantities:

1. **Triangle area**.
2. **Distance from the orthocenter `H` to the centroid `G`.**

## Algorithm

For the centroid of a triangle the distance to any side is one third of the
corresponding altitude.  Hence the altitude to side `a` is `3 g_a` and the area
is

```
A = 1/2 * a * (3 g_a) = 3/2 * a * g_a.
```

The centroid also satisfies `g_a = 2A/(3a)`, giving the other sides

```
b = a * g_a / g_b,
 c = a * g_a / g_c.
```

With all sides known we find the circumradius `R = abc/(4A)` and use the Euler
line relation `OG^2 = R^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)/9`.  Since `HG = 2Â·OG`, the
sought distance is

```
HG = 2 * sqrt(max(0, R^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)/9)).
```

Both values are printed with three digits after the decimal point.
