# HIKE - Hike on a Graph

The board is a complete undirected graph with coloured edges. Three
pieces start at given vertices and in one move we may move one piece
along an edge whose colour matches the colour of the edge between the
other two pieces. The task is to bring all pieces to the same vertex in
the fewest number of moves.

With at most 50 vertices the configuration of the three pieces can be
encoded as a triple `(a,b,c)` giving at most `50^3` states. A breadth‑first
search over this state space yields the optimal number of moves.
From a state `(a,b,c)` with distance `d` we enqueue:

* `(x,b,c)` for every vertex `x` where colour `a→x` equals colour `b→c`;
* `(a,y,c)` for every `y` where colour `b→y` equals colour `a→c`;
* `(a,b,z)` for every `z` where colour `c→z` equals colour `a→b`.

A visited array of size `n³` stores distances. The first dequeued state
with `a=b=c` gives the answer. If the queue empties, the situation is
impossible.

The algorithm runs in `O(n³)` space and `O(n⁴)` time, which is under
six million operations for `n ≤ 50`.
