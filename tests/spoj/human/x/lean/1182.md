# SPOJ SORTBIT - Sorted bit sequence

We are given integers `m`, `n` (same sign) and `k`.  Every integer in `[m,n]` is
represented as a 32‑bit two's–complement string.  After sorting these strings by
popcount and then lexicographically, we must output the `k`‑th number.

The lexicographic order on fixed 32‑bit strings is the same as the order of
their unsigned integer values, so we work entirely with unsigned numbers.
Negative numbers are shifted by `2^32` to obtain their unsigned value.

For each popcount `p` we can compute how many numbers in `[0,x]` have exactly
`p` bits set using a combinational DP.  Scanning the bits of `x` from high to
low, whenever a `1` is encountered we may replace it by `0` and freely choose
the remaining `p` ones among the lower bits using binomial coefficients.

To answer a query, we:

1. convert `m` and `n` to unsigned and count how many numbers of each popcount
   lie in the interval using the function above;
2. find the popcount group containing the `k`‑th number;
3. binary search for the smallest value whose prefix contains at least `k`
   numbers of that popcount.

The resulting unsigned number is converted back to signed form (subtracting
`2^32` when the highest bit is set).  Each operation examines only 32 bits, so
complexity per test case is `O(32 log 2^32)`.
