# LUCKYNUM - Lucky Numbers

The party uses a special elimination sieve. Starting from the sequence of
consecutive integers beginning with 2, repeatedly take the first number `p`
as **lucky** and remove every `p`-th number remaining in the queue. The first
few steps are:

1. `2` is lucky, remove every 2nd number → `3,5,7,9,...`
2. `3` is lucky, remove every 3rd number → `5,7,11,13,...`
3. `5` is lucky, remove every 5th number → `7,11,13,17,23,25,29,31,...`

Continuing this process generates the sequence `2,3,5,7,11,13,17,23,25,29,...`.

To answer queries up to `n = 3000` we pre–compute the first 3000 lucky numbers.
Each step removes every `p`-th element from the remaining list, which can be
performed with simple list filtering. Once the table is built, answering a
query is just indexing into this array.
