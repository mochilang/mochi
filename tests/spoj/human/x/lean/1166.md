# [Dead Fraction](https://www.spoj.com/problems/DEADFR/)

## Problem Summary
Given a decimal number of the form `0.ddd...` ending with an ellipsis, the digits after the ellipsis repeat indefinitely. We must
find the rational number with the smallest denominator whose decimal expansion matches the given digits and print it as
`numerator/denominator` in lowest terms. The input consists of several such decimals, one per line, terminated by a line containing `0`.

## Algorithm
For a line `0.s...`, remove the leading `0.` and trailing `...` to obtain the digit string `s` with length `n`. Interpret `s` as an
integer `A`. For each possible length `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ n) of the repeating suffix:

1. Let `B` be the integer represented by the first `n − k` digits (or `0` if `n = k`).
2. The unreduced fraction is `(A − B) / (10^n − 10^{n−k})`.
3. Reduce this fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor.

Among all choices of `k`, select the reduced fraction with the smallest denominator. This brute-force search considers every way to
split `s` into a non-repeating prefix and a repeating suffix, guaranteeing the minimal denominator. Output the chosen fraction.
