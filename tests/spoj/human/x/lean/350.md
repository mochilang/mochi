## Problem Summary
Given a profile of `N` integer elevations, reduce elevations (never increase) so that the resulting landscape has at most `K` peaks. A peak is a maximal contiguous block of equal height with lower height on both sides or the boundary. Removing one unit of elevation costs one unit of volume. For each test case output the minimum volume of earth to remove.

## Algorithm
1. Precompute for every interval `[l, r]` the minimum cost to make it non-decreasing (a rising slope) and non-increasing (a falling slope). Because we may only lower heights, for a non-decreasing interval we scan from right to left lowering elements that are too high; the non-increasing costs are computed symmetrically from left to right.
2. Use dynamic programming over a decomposition into alternating rising and falling segments. With `k` peaks the landscape is divided into `2k` segments: rising then falling for each peak. For each `k ≤ K`, compute `dp[j][i]` – the minimum cost to cover the first `i` positions using `j` segments, where segment directions alternate between rising and falling. Transitions try every possible split of the last segment and use the precomputed costs.
3. The answer is the minimum over all `k ≤ K` of `dp[2k][N-1]` (zero-indexed arrays).

The precomputation is `O(N^2)` and the DP is `O(K·N^2)`, which satisfies the limits `N ≤ 1000` and `K ≤ 25`.
