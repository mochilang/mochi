# Longest path in a tree

[Problem link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PT07Z/)

Given an unweighted undirected tree, we must output the length of its longest simple path, i.e. the tree's diameter.

## Algorithm

- Construct an adjacency list from the \(N-1\) edges.
- Run a breadth-first search from an arbitrary node (node 1) to find the farthest node \(s\).
- Run BFS again starting from \(s\) to obtain the maximum distance \(d\).
- The value \(d\) is the length of the longest path and is printed.

Both BFS traversals examine each edge once, so the complexity is \(O(N)\).
