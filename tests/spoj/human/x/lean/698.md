# PLHOP - Plane Hopping

We are given an `N × N` matrix of ticket costs where entry `(i,j)` is the cost to fly from
city `i` to city `j`. A traveler must take at least `K` flights between cities. With
non‑negative costs, the cheapest path with at least `K` flights uses exactly `K` flights.

Consider the cost matrix as an adjacency matrix of a complete graph and raise it to the
`K`‑th power using min‑plus matrix multiplication (use `min` as addition and `+` as
multiplication). Binary exponentiation computes `A^K` in `O(N^3 log K)` time, and the
resulting matrix provides the minimal costs.
