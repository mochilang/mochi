## Problem Summary
Read integers from standard input and echo them one per line until the value `42` appears. The sentinel `42` and any later numbers are not printed.

## Algorithm
1. Repeatedly read an integer from standard input.
2. If end of file is reached, stop.
3. If the integer is `42`, terminate.
4. Otherwise print the integer followed by a newline and continue.

This algorithm processes each input once and uses constant extra memory.
