## Problem Summary
Read integers from standard input and echo each value until the sentinel `42` appears. Stop processing when `42` is read and do not print it or any subsequent numbers.

## Algorithm
1. Read all input from standard input.
2. For each line, parse the integer value.
3. If the value is `42`, terminate the loop.
4. Otherwise, print the number.

The algorithm processes each number once, giving linear time complexity and constant additional memory usage.
