## Problem Summary
Read integers from standard input and output each on its own line until the value `42` appears. The sentinel `42` and any following numbers are not printed.

## Algorithm
1. Read an integer from input.
2. If reading fails (EOF), stop.
3. If the number is `42`, terminate.
4. Otherwise, print the number and repeat.

This algorithm runs in linear time relative to the number of processed integers and uses constant additional memory.
