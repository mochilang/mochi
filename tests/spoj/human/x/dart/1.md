## Problem Summary
Read integers from standard input and print each on its own line until the value `42` appears. The sentinel `42` and any subsequent values are not printed.

## Algorithm
1. Continuously read lines from stdin.
2. Parse each line as an integer.
3. If the integer equals `42`, terminate the loop.
4. Otherwise, output the integer followed by a newline.

The algorithm runs in linear time relative to the number of input values and uses constant extra space.
