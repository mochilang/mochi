# SPOJ TEST - Life, the Universe, and Everything

We repeatedly read integers from standard input and echo them until encountering 42.

## Algorithm
1. Loop reading lines from input.
2. If the current line is `42`, terminate.
3. Otherwise, print the line and continue.

This brute-force approach satisfies the problem requirements since input size is tiny and reading continues only until the sentinel value appears.
