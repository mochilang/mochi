## Problem Summary
Read integers from standard input and echo them one per line until the value `42` is encountered. The sentinel `42` and any subsequent values are ignored.

## Algorithm
1. Repeatedly read an integer using `read` with `iostat` to detect EOF.
2. Terminate the loop if input ends or the value is `42`.
3. Otherwise, output the integer using `write` with the `I0` format to avoid extra spaces.

The procedure runs in linear time and constant memory.
