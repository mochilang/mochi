## Problem Summary
Read integers from standard input and echo each one on its own line until the value `42` appears. The sentinel `42` and any following numbers are not printed.

## Algorithm
1. Continuously read an integer.
2. If the read fails (EOF), stop.
3. If the integer equals `42`, terminate the loop.
4. Otherwise, output the integer followed by a newline.

The process runs in linear time relative to the number of input values and uses constant extra memory.
