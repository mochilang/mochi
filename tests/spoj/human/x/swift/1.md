## Problem Summary
Read integers from standard input and output them one per line until the value `42` is encountered. The sentinel `42` and any subsequent values are not printed.

## Algorithm
1. Repeatedly read a line from stdin and parse it as an integer.
2. If parsing fails, stop (EOF).
3. If the integer is `42`, break out of the loop.
4. Otherwise, print the integer followed by a newline.

This algorithm runs in linear time relative to the number of inputs and uses constant extra memory.
