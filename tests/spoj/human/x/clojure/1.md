## Problem Summary
Read integers from standard input and echo them one per line until the value `42` is encountered. The sentinel `42` and any subsequent values are not printed.

## Algorithm
1. Read a line from standard input.
2. Parse it as an integer.
3. If the integer equals `42`, stop.
4. Otherwise, print the number and repeat from step 1.

The algorithm runs in linear time relative to the number of input values and uses constant extra memory.
