# TEST - Life, the Universe, and Everything

We repeatedly read integers from standard input and output each one until the sentinel value `42` is read, after which processing stops.

## Algorithm
1. Iterate over each line of input.
2. Convert the line to an integer `n`.
3. If `n` equals `42`, terminate.
4. Otherwise, print `n`.

This runs in `O(n)` time where `n` is the number of integers processed before encountering `42` and uses `O(1)` additional space.
