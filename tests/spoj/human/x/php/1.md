## Problem Summary
Read integers from standard input and echo each value on its own line until the number `42` is encountered. The sentinel `42` and any following values are not printed.

## Algorithm
1. Open standard input for reading line by line.
2. For each line, convert it to an integer.
3. If the integer equals `42`, terminate processing.
4. Otherwise, output the number followed by a newline.

The algorithm is linear in the number of input values and uses constant additional memory.
