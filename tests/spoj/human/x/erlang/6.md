## Problem Summary
Given up to 1000 expressions of the form `A+B`, `A-B`, or `A*B` where `A` and `B` are non-negative integers (up to 500 digits),
compute the result and print the calculation as it would appear when done by hand. For multiplication with multiple digits in the
multiplier, display each partial product aligned to its corresponding digit.

## Algorithm
1. Parse the input line to separate operands `A`, `B` and the operator `op`.
2. Evaluate the result using Erlang's arbitrary-precision integers.
3. For addition and subtraction:
   - Determine `width = max(len(A), len(op||B), len(result))`.
   - Print `A` and `op||B` right-aligned to `width`.
   - Print a dashed line of length `max(len(op||B), len(result))` and the result right-aligned.
4. For multiplication:
   - Multiply `A` by each digit of `B` from right to left to produce partial products with shifts.
   - Let `width` be the maximum among lengths of `A`, `op||B`, the final result, and any shifted partial product.
   - Print `A`, `op||B`, and a dashed line using `max(len(op||B), len(first partial))`.
   - If `B` has more than one digit, print each partial product appropriately shifted, then a full-width dashed line and the final
     result.
5. Separate test cases with a blank line.

The algorithm runs in linear time relative to the number of digits.
