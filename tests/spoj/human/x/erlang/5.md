# [The Next Palindrome](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PALIN)

## Problem Summary
Given a positive integer `K` with up to one million digits, find the smallest palindrome strictly greater than `K`.

## Algorithm
1. Read the number as a list of digits.
2. If all digits are `9`, output `1` followed by zeros and ending with `1`.
3. Otherwise, check whether the left half is smaller than the mirrored right half.
4. Mirror the left side onto the right to form a palindrome.
5. If the mirrored number is not larger than `K`, increment the middle digit(s) and propagate the carry to the left, mirroring changes to the right.
6. Output the resulting palindrome.

This procedure runs in linear time relative to the length of the input number.
