# Transform the Expression

[Problem link](https://www.spoj.com/problems/ONP/)

## Algorithm
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each expression:
   - Scan characters left to right keeping a stack for operators.
   - When encountering a letter, append it to the output.
   - When encountering `(` push it onto the stack.
   - When encountering `)` pop operators from the stack and append them to the output until the matching `(` is removed.
   - When encountering an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`) push it onto the stack.
3. After processing the expression, any remaining operators on the stack are appended to the output.

The expressions are fully parenthesized, so operator precedence is handled by the parentheses. The algorithm runs in O(n) time per expression with O(n) stack space in the worst case.
