# [Complete the Sequence!](https://www.spoj.com/problems/CMPLS)

## Algorithm
1. Use forward differences: starting from the sequence, repeatedly take
   successive differences until the last row becomes constant. For a
   degree-`d` polynomial, the `d`-th differences are constant.
2. To generate each of the `C` required terms:
   - Extend the bottom row by repeating its last value.
   - Moving upward, extend each row with the sum of its last element and the
     new value from the row below.
3. The values appended to the top row are the continuation of the sequence.

This extrapolates the minimal-degree polynomial that fits the given terms and
runs in `O(S * C)` time.
