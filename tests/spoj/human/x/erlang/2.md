# PRIME1 - Prime Generator

## Algorithm
1. Precompute all primes up to 32,000 using a simple sieve. This covers the square root of the maximum `n` (1e9).
2. For each query range `[m, n]`:
   - Ensure `m` is at least 2.
   - Use a segmented sieve. For each precomputed prime `p`, start marking multiples within `[m, n]` beginning at `p*p` or `ceil(m/p)*p`, whichever is larger.
   - Store marked numbers in a map of composites.
   - Iterate through `[m, n]` and print numbers not marked as composite.
3. Separate outputs of consecutive test cases with a blank line.

The segmented sieve runs in `O((n-m+1) log log n)` per test case and uses `O(n-m+1)` additional memory.
