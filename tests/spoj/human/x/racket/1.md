## Problem Summary
Read integers from standard input and echo them one per line until the value `42` is encountered. The sentinel `42` and any subsequent values are not printed.

## Algorithm
1. Repeatedly scan an integer from stdin.
2. If the scan fails (EOF), stop.
3. If the integer is `42`, break out of the loop.
4. Otherwise, print the integer followed by a newline.

The algorithm runs in linear time with respect to the number of input values and uses constant extra memory.
