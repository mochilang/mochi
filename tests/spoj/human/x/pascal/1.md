# SPOJ TEST - Life, the Universe, and Everything

* **Problem:** Read integers and output them until the value `42` is encountered. Once `42` is read, terminate without printing it or any subsequent numbers.
* **Approach:**
  1. Repeatedly read integers from standard input.
  2. After each read, check if the value equals `42`.
     * If yes, break the loop.
     * Otherwise, print the value on its own line.
  3. Stop when `42` is encountered or when input ends.
* **Complexity:** Each number is processed once. Time complexity is `O(n)` for `n` numbers read; memory usage is `O(1)`.
