## Problem Summary
Read integers from standard input and echo them one per line until the value `42` is encountered. The sentinel `42` and any subsequent values are not printed.

## Algorithm
1. Repeatedly read an integer using `scanf`.
2. If reading fails (EOF), stop.
3. If the integer equals `42`, terminate.
4. Otherwise, print the integer followed by a newline.

The algorithm runs in linear time with constant memory.
