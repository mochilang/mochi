# TEST - Life, the Universe, and Everything

Read integers from standard input and echo them to the output until the number `42` is encountered. After seeing `42`, terminate without printing it.

**Algorithm**
1. Loop reading lines.
2. Parse each line as an integer.
3. If the integer is `42`, break the loop.
4. Otherwise, write the integer to the output.

This linear scan stops at the first `42`, so the time complexity is O(n) with constant memory.
