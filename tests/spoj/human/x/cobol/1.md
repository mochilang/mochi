## Problem Summary
Read integers from standard input and echo them one per line until the value `42` is encountered. The sentinel `42` and any subsequent values are not printed.

## Algorithm
1. Repeatedly read a line using `ACCEPT`.
2. If the line equals `"42"`, terminate.
3. Otherwise, output the trimmed line using `DISPLAY`.

The algorithm runs in linear time with constant memory.
