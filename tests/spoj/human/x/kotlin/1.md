## Problem Summary
Read integers from standard input and echo them one per line until the value `42` is encountered. The sentinel `42` and any subsequent values are not printed.

## Algorithm
1. Read integers sequentially from standard input using a scanner.
2. If the integer is `42`, stop reading and terminate.
3. Otherwise, append the integer and a newline to a buffer.
4. After the loop, output the buffer contents.

The algorithm runs in linear time relative to the number of inputs and uses constant extra memory.
