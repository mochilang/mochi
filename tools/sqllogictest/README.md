# SQL Logic Test Tool

This tool downloads a small subset of the [SQL Logic Test](https://github.com/gregrahn/sqllogictest) suite and converts a few queries into Mochi programs.

Run `go run ./tools/sqllogictest` from the repository root. The tests are stored under `tests/dataset/logic/<test-name>` and executed to generate expected output files.
