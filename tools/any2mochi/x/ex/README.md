Package ex implements helpers for translating small Elixir programs into Mochi.
The conversion relies on the Elixir language server to obtain symbol
information and falls back to lightâ€‘weight parsing when necessary.

The main entry points are `FromLSP`, which converts source code by querying the
language server, and `Convert` which uses the bundled parser. Both functions
return Mochi source.
