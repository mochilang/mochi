# a2mochi Scala Converter

Completed programs: 14/104
Date: 2025-07-28

This directory contains the helper code and golden files for converting Scala
sources under `tests/transpiler/x/scala` into Mochi AST form.
Each `.scala` file has a matching `.mochi` and `.ast` file generated by the
tests when run with the `-update` flag.

The converter now prepends a header comment with the current Mochi version and
generation timestamp (GMT+7). It also includes the original Scala source as a
block comment at the top of the emitted Mochi file.
