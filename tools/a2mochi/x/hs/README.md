# a2mochi Haskell Converter

This package provides a small Haskell frontend for the `a2mochi` tool. It parses
very simple Haskell programs and converts them into Mochi AST form. Only a tiny
subset of the language is recognised â€“ single line function declarations,
variable bindings and trivial `main` blocks built from `putStrLn`, `print` and
`mapM_` loops.
