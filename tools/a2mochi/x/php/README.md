This directory holds golden outputs for the PHP to Mochi converter. Each `.php`
source in `tests/transpiler/x/php` has a matching `.mochi` and `.ast` file
generated by the tests. Generated Mochi code is printed via the `ast` package
and executed to verify runtime behaviour matches the original VM programs.

Completed programs: 5/104
