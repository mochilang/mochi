# ts2mochi

This package converts a limited subset of TypeScript into Mochi source code. It is
implemented in pure Go and relies on the TypeScript language server to obtain
symbol information. It is mainly used for testing the TypeScript backend by
roundâ€‘tripping compiler output.

## Supported features

- Function declarations with parameter and return types derived via the
  language server
- `return` statements
- `console.log` translated to `print`
- Numeric literals and identifiers
- Array literals
- Simple call expressions

## Unsupported features

The converter is intentionally small and does not understand most
TypeScript syntax such as loops, conditionals, classes, generics or
module systems. Unsupported statements in function bodies are ignored.
