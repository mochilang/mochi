# Mochi Language Features

This section outlines each major feature of the Mochi programming language. Each page contains a short description and practical examples that you can run directly with the `mochi` CLI.

- [Variables](variables.md) introduce immutable and mutable bindings as well as destructuring.
- [Control Flow](control-flow.md) covers conditionals, loops and pattern matching.
- [Functions](functions.md) explains named and anonymous functions plus recursion.
- [Collections](collections.md) details built-in lists, maps and sets.
- [Tests](tests.md) shows the lightweight test framework.
- [Generative AI](generative-ai.md) demonstrates calling large language models.
- [HTTP Fetch](http-fetch.md) describes retrieving JSON over the network.
- [Union Types](union-types.md) discusses custom data structures with variants.
- [Streams and Agents](streams.md) introduces event streams and long-lived agents.

These topics build upon the language specification and provide a hands-on tour of Mochi's capabilities.
