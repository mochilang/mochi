## Foreign Function Interface

Mochi can call into Go, Python and TypeScript libraries using the `import`
statement and `extern` declarations. Imported modules expose their values
through an FFI runtime so Mochi code can invoke them directly. When `as`
is omitted, the last path component becomes the module name.

```mochi
import python "math" as math

extern fun math.sqrt(x: float): float

print(math.sqrt(49.0))
```

Modules may be loaded from the host language's package system or from a
local file. Functions and variables must be declared with `extern` before
use so the compiler knows their types.
