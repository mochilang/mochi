# C# Converter

This package contains an experimental converter that translates a subset of
C# source code into Mochi. The implementation relies on the OmniSharp
language server via LSP. A minimal dotnet installation is ensured at runtime.

## Architecture

* `Convert` and `ConvertFile` are the entry points.
* Symbols are extracted from OmniSharp using `EnsureAndParse`.
* Basic type and function stubs are generated by `writeSymbols`.
* A very small translator (`convertBody`) performs lightweight statement
  conversions for constructs like `for`, `while`, and `if`.

## Supported Features

* Classes, structs, interfaces and enums are mapped to Mochi `type` blocks.
* Functions, methods and constructors emit `fun` stubs with parameter and
  return type hints when available.
* Fields and properties become `let` bindings at the top level.

## Unsupported Features

* Generics beyond simple `List` or `Dictionary` types.
* Attributes, annotations and preprocessor directives.
* Complex expression translation within method bodies.
